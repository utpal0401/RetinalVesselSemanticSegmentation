 Rules of TOMAC and any amendments thereto, and the award given by the arbitrators shall be final
 and binding on both parties.
 
 4.   VALIDITY    In the event that anything herein contained is inconsistent with any applicable international
 convention or national law which cannot be departed from by private contract, the provisions hereof shall be
 null and void to the extent of such inconsistency but no further.
 
 5.   DEMISE CLAUSE    If the Vessel is not owned by, or chartered by demise to the Carrier (as may be the
 case notwithstanding anything that appears to the contrary) this Bill of Lading shall take effect only as a con-
 tract with the owner or demise charterer, as the case may be, as principal, made through the agency of the
 Carrier  which acts as agent only and shall be under no personal liability whatsoever in respect thereof. If de-
 spite the foregoing, it shall be adjudged that the Carrier and not the owner or demise charterer is a party to
 this Bill of Lading and/or a bailee of the Goods, all limitations of and exemptions from liability provided by
 law and by the terms hereof shall be available to the Carrier.
 
 6.    DEFENCE AND LIMITS
 (1)  The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Bill of Lading shall apply in any action against
 
 the Carrier for loss of or damage to the Goods or delay in delivery, whether the action be founded in
 contract or in tort.
 
 (2)  If an action is brought against any servant, agent or Sub-Contractor of the Carrier, such person shall
 be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the Carrier is entitled to invoke
 under this Bill of Lading.
 
 (3)  The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the Carrier and his servants, agents or Sub-Contractors
 shall in no case exceed the limits provided for in this Bill of Lading.
 
 7.   PERIOD OF RESPONSIBILITY    The Carrier shall not be liable in any capacity whatsoever for any loss or
 damage to the Goods occurring before loading onto the Vessel at the Port of Loading or after discharge from
 the Vessel at the Port of Discharge, whether the Goods are awaiting shipment, landed or stored or put into
 craft, barge, lighter or other thing whether belonging to the Carrier or not or pending transhipment at any
 stage of the carriage.
 
 8.    SCOPE OF VOYAGE
 (1)  The Carrier has liberty to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property, to call at any port or ports
 
 in or out of the customary or advertised route, in any order whatsoever for the purpose of discharging
 and loading goods and/or embarking and disembarking passengers, or taking in fuel and other neces-
 sary supplies or for any other purpose whatsoever, to drydock with or without Goods on board if
 thought necessary or convenient, to adjust compasses, to sail without pilots, and to tow and assist
 ships in all situations and circumstances.
 
 (2)  Any action(s) taken by the Carrier under this Clause shall be deemed to be included within the scope
 of the contractual carriage and such action(s) or delay resulting therefrom shall not be deemed to be a
 deviation.
 
 9.   DELAY, CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS    In no event shall the Carrier be liable for any loss of profit or conse-
 quential loss or damage. Arrival times are not guaranteed by the Carrier.
 
 10.   UNKNOWN CLAUSE
 (1)  Any reference on the face hereof to marks, numbers, description, quantity, gauge, weight, measure,
 
 nature, kind, value and any other particulars of the Goods have been furnished by the Merchant, and
 the Carrier shall not responsible for the accuracy thereof. The Merchant warrants to the Carrier
 that the particulars furnished by him are correct and shall indemnify the Carrier against all loss, dam-
 age, expenses, liability, penalties and fines arising out of or resulting from inaccuracy there of.
 
 (2)  If the cargo received by the Carrier is packed into container(s), loaded on pallet(s) or unitized into simi-
 lar article(s) of transport by or on behalf of the Merchant, this Bill of Lading is prima facie evidence
 only of the shipment of the number of such article(s) as shown on the face hereof; and the order and
 condition of the contents and the marks, numbers, number and kind of packages or pieces, descrip-
 tion, quality, quantity, gauge, measure, nature, kind and value noted on the face hereof are unknown
 to the Carrier. The Carrier shall accept no responsibility therefor.
 
 11.   MARKS AND DESCRIPTION
 (1)  The Carrier shall not be liable for failure of or delay in delivery in accordance with marks unless such
 
 marks shall have been clearly and durably stamped or marked upon the Goods or package(s) by the
 Merchant before shipment in letters and numbers not less than 5 centimeters high, together with the
 names of the port of discharge and/or destination.
 
 (2)  In no circumstances shall the Carrier be responsible for delivery in accordance with other than leading
 marks.
 
 (3)  The Merchant warrants to the Carrier that the marks on the Goods or package(s) correspond to the
 marks shown on this Bill of Lading and also in all respects comply with all laws and regulations in force
 at the port of discharge and/or destination, and shall indemnify the Carrier against all loss, damage, ex-
 penses, penalties and fines arising out of or resulting from incorrectness or incompleteness thereof.
 
 (4)  Goods which cannot be identified by marks and numbers, cargo sweepings, liquid residue and any
 unclaimed Goods not otherwise accounted for shall be allocated for the purpose of completing deliv-
 ery to the various merchants of goods of like character, in proportion to any apparent shortage, loss of
 weight or damage, and such Goods or parts thereof shall be accepted as full and complete delivery.
 
 12.  INSPECTION OF GOODS
 (1)  The Carrier shall be entitled, but under no obligation, to open any container or package at any time
 
 and to inspect, reweigh, remeasure, revalue or repack the Goods without notice to the Merchant.
 (2)  If paragraph (1) above applies or if by order of the authorities at any place, a container or package has
 
 to be opened, the Carrier will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of any opening, un-
 packing, inspection, reweighing, remeasurement, revaluation or repacking. The Merchant shall indem-
 nify the Carrier for the cost of all measures taken as above.
 
 13.  DECK CARGO
 (1)  The Carrier has the right to carry the Goods in container(s) under deck or on deck.
 (2)  When the Goods in container(s) are carried on deck, the Carrier shall not be required to specially note,
 
 mark or stamp any statement of ""on deck stowage"" on the face hereof, any custom to the contrary
 notwithstanding. The Goods so carried shall be subject to the applicable Hague Rules legislation as
 provided for in Clause 2 hereof, and the stowage of such Goods shall be deemed to constitute under
 deck stowage for all purposes including general average.
 
 (3)  The Carrier shall not be liable in any capacity whatsoever for any non-delivery, misdelivery, any delay
 or loss of or damage to the Goods which are carried on deck and specially stated herein to be so car-
 ried, whether or not caused by the Carrier's negligence or the Vessel's unseaworthiness.
 
 14. LIVE ANIMALS    Live animals are carried without responsibility on the part of the Carrier for any accident,
 injury, illness, death, loss or damage arising at any time whether caused by unseaworthiness or negligence
 or any other cause whatsoever.
 
 15.  DANGEROUS GOODS
 (1)  The Carrier undertakes to carry Goods of an explosive, inflammable, radioactive, corrosive, damaging,
 
 noxious, hazardous, poisonous, injurious or dangerous nature only upon the Carrier's acceptance of a
 prior written application by the Merchant for the carriage of such Goods.  Such application must accu-
 rately state the nature, name, label and classification of the Goods as well as the method of rendering
 them innocuous, with the full names and addresses of the shipper and the consignee.
 
 (2)  Whenever the Goods are discovered to have been shipped without complying with paragraph (1)
 above or the Goods are found to be contraband or prohibited by any laws or regulations of the port of
 loading, discharge or call or any place or waters during the carriage, the Carrier shall be entitled to
 have such Goods rendered innocuous, thrown overboard or discharged or otherwise disposed of at
 the Carrier's discretion without compensation and the Merchant shall be liable for and indemnify the
 Carrier against any kind of loss, damage or liability including loss of freight, and any expenses directly
 or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.
 
 (3)  The Carrier may exercise or enjoy the right or benefit conferred upon the Carrier under the preceding
 paragraph whenever it is apprehended that the Goods shipped in compliance with paragraph (1) above
 have become dangerous to the Carrier, the Vessel, other cargo, persons and/or other property.
 
 16. VALUABLE GOODS    The Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with plat-
 inum, gold, silver, jewellery, precious stones, other precious metals, radioisotopes, precious chemicals, cur-
 rency, negotiable instruments, securities, writings, documents, pictures, embroideries, works of art, curios,
 heirlooms, collections of every nature or any other valuable goods whatsoever including goods having par-
 ticular value only for the Merchant, unless the true nature and value of the Goods have been declared in
 writing by the Merchant before receipt of the Goods by the Carrier, and the same is inserted in this Bill of
 Lading and ad valorem freight has been prepaid thereon.
 
 17.  HEAVY LIFT
 (1)  The weight of a single piece or package exceeding 1 metric ton gross must be declared by the Mer-
 
 chant in writing before receipt by the Carrier.
 (2)  In case of the Merchant's failure to make the above declaration, the Carrier shall not be responsible
 
 for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods, and at the same time the Merchant
 shall be liable for loss of or damage to any property or for personal injury arising as a result of the
 
 Merchant's said failure and shall indemnify the Carrier against loss or liability of any kind suffered or
 incurred by the Carrier as a result of such failure.
 
 18. IRON AND STEEL    The term 'apparent external good order and condition' when used in this Bill of Lad-
 ing with reference to iron, steel or metal products does not mean that the Goods, when received, are free
 of visible rust or moisture. If the Merchant so requests, a substitute Bill of Lading will be issued omitting the
 above definition and setting forth any notation as to rust or moisture which may appear on the mates' or
 tally clerks' receipts.
 
 19.  DISCHARGE / DELIVERY
 (1)  The Goods may be discharged, without notice, as soon as the Vessel is ready to unload, continuously
 
 day and night, Sundays and holidays included.
 (2)  If the Merchant fails to take delivery of the Goods immediately after the Vessel is ready to discharge
 
 them, the Carrier shall be at liberty to store the Goods at the risk and expense of the Merchant.
 (3)  Optional delivery is only granted when arranged prior to the shipment of the Goods and expressed in
 
 this Bill of Lading. The Merchant desiring to avail himself of the option so expressed must give notice
 to the Carrier's agent at the first port of the Vessel's call named in the option, at least 48 hours prior
 to the Vessel's arrival there, otherwise the Goods shall be discharged at any of the optional ports at
 the Carrier's choice and the Carrier's responsibility shall then cease.
 
 (4)  If the Goods are unclaimed during a reasonable time, or whenever in the Carrier's judgement the
 Goods will become deteriorated, decayed or worthless, the Carrier may, at his discretion and without
 any responsibility attaching to him, sell, abandon or otherwise dispose of the Goods solely at the risk
 and expense of the Merchant.
 
 20.   TRANSHIPMENT
 (1)  (i) In case of through carriage under this Bill of Lading, the Merchant constitutes the Carrier his agents
 
 to enter into contracts with others for the pre-carriage and/or on-carriage of the Goods and/or for the
 storing, lightering, transhipment or other dealing therewith, prior to, or in the course of, or subsequent
 to the carriage in the Carrier's vessel without any liability attaching to him in respect of such agency.
 (ii) The responsibility of each carrier acting as such is limited to that part of the transport actually
 undertaken by him, and the Carrier shall not be under any liability for damage and/or loss arising from
 whatsoever cause during any other part of the transport, even though the freight for the whole trans-
 port has been collected by the Carrier.
 
 (2)  Any statement of the port or place, whether littoral or inland, ``in the column ""Final Destination"" on the
 face hereof is solely for the purpose of the Merchant's reference, and in case the columns ""(Local
 Vessel)"" and ""(From)"" on the face hereof are filled up and this Bill of Lading is issued at a place other
 than the port of loading onto the Vessel, any statement herein as to the shipment of the Goods shall
 be construed to relate only to the time when and place where the Goods were loaded on board the
 local vessel. The Carrier's liability, in those events, shall be determined in accordance with paragraph
 (1) of this Clause.
 
 (3)  The Carrier shall be at liberty, whether or not arranged beforehand or indicated on the face hereof, to
 tranship the whole or any part of the Goods, with or without notice, at any port or place for any pur-
 pose whatsoever, or to forward the same by any means of transport by water, land or air, whether
 owned or operated by the Carrier or not. The Carrier's liability shall, in this event, cease when the
 Goods leave the Vessel's tackle.
 
 21.  MATTERS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE
 (1)  The Carrier shall use reasonable endeavours to complete the transport and to deliver the goods at the
 
 place designated for delivery.
 (2)  If at any time the carriage is or is likely to be affected by any hindrance, risk, delay, difficulty, or dis-
 
 advantage of any kind and howsoever arising (even though the circumstances giving rise to such
 hindrance, risk, delay, difficulty or disadvantage existed at the time this contract was entered into or
 when the Goods were received for carriage), the Carrier (whether or not the carriage is commenced)
 may, without prior notice to the Merchant and at the sole discretion of the Carrier, either:
 
 (a)   Carry the Goods to the named Port of Discharge by an alternative route to that indicated in this Bill
 of Lading or that which is usual for Goods consigned to that Port of Discharge, (if the Carrier elects
 to invoke the terms of sub-paragraph (a), then notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 8 hereof,
 the Carrier shall be entitled to charge such additional freight as the Carrier may determine); or
 
 (b)   Suspend the carriage of the Goods and store them ashore or afloat upon the terms of this Bill of
 Lading and endeavour to forward them as soon as possible, but the Carrier makes no representa-
 tions as to the maximum period of suspension (if the Carrier elects to invoke the terms of Sub-para-
 graph (b) then the Carrier shall be entitled to such additional freight as the Carrier may determine); or
 
 (c)    Abandon the carriage of the Goods and place the Goods at the Merchant's disposal at any place or
 port which the Carrier may deem safe and convenient, whereupon the responsibility of the Carrier
 in respect of such Goods shall cease. The Carrier shall nevertheless be entitled to full freight on the
 Goods received for carriage, and the Merchant shall pay any additional costs of the carriage to, and
 delivery and storage at, such place or port. If the Carrier elects to use an alternative route under
 sub-paragraph (a) or to suspend the carriage under sub-paragraph (b) this shall not prejudice his right
 subsequently to abandon the carriage.
 
 (3)  The Carrier may comply with any orders or recommendations given by any government or authority,
 or any person acting or purporting to act as or on behalf of such government or authority, or having
 under the terms of any insurance on any conveyance employed by the Carrier the right to give orders
 or directions.
 
 22.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 (1)  When the Carrier is liable for compensation in respect of any loss of or damage to the Goods, such
 
 compensation shall be calculated by reference to the value of the Goods at the place and time they
 are discharged from the Vessel, or at the place and time they should have been discharged.
 
 For the purpose of determining the extent of the Carrier's liability for loss of or damage to the
 Goods, the value of the Goods is presumed to be the invoice value plus freight and insurance pre-
 mium, if paid.
 
 (2)  The Carrier shall in no event be liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods in
 an amount exceeding 666.67 Units of Account (Special Drawing Right) per package or unit or 2 Units
 of Account per kilogramme of gross weight of the Goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher,
 unless the value of the Goods is declared in writing by the shipper before shipment and the nature
 and value thereof is inserted in this Bill of Lading and extra freight is paid as agreed. In such case,
 even if the actual value of the Goods per package or unit exceeds such declared value, the value de-
 clared shall nevertheless be deemed to be the value of the Goods. The Carrier's liability shall not ex-
 ceed such declared value and any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the basis of
 such declared value.
 
 Where the cargo has been packed into container(s) or unitized into similar article(s) of transport
 by or on behalf of the Merchant, and when the number of packages or units packed into container(s)
 or unitized into similar article(s) of transport is not enumerated on the face thereof, each container or
 similar article including the entire contents thereof shall be considered as one package for the pur-
 pose of the application of the limitation of liability provided for herein.
 
 23.  NOTICE OF CLAIM AND TIME BAR
 (1)  Unless notice of loss of or damage to the Goods indicating the general nature of such loss or damage
 
 be given in writing to the Carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of removal
 of the Goods into the custody of the person entitled to take delivery thereof under this Bill of Lading
 or, if the loss or damage is not apparent, within three days of the delivery of the Goods, such removal
 or delivery shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the Carrier of the Goods in the amount and
 condition described in this Bill of Lading.
 
 (2)  In any event the Carrier shall be discharged from his liability for the Goods unless arbitration is filed
 pursuant to Clause 3(2) hereof within one year from the date of delivery of the Goods or the date
 when the Goods should have been delivered in the case of the total loss or non-delivery of the Goods.
 
 24.  FREIGHT AND CHARGES
 (1)  Freight and charges shall be deemed fully earned on receipt of the Goods by the Carrier and shall be
 
 paid in any event, whether the Vessel and/or the Goods be lost or not, or the transport be broken up
 or frustrated or abandoned at any stage of the entire transit.
 
 (2)  The payment of freight and/or charges shall be made in full and in cash without any offset, counter-
 claim or deduction. Where freight is payable at the port of discharge, destination or any other place,
 such freight and all other charges shall be paid in the currency named in this Bill of Lading or, at the
 Carrier's option, in other currency subject to the regulations of the freight conference concerned or
 custom at the place of payment.
 
 (3)  For the purpose of verifying the freight basis, the Carrier may at any time open any container or other
 package or unit in order to ascertain the weight, measurement or value of the Goods. If the particu-
 lars furnished by the Merchant are incorrect, it is agreed that a sum equal to either five times the dif-
 ference between the correct freight and the freight charged or to double the correct freight less the
 freight charged, whichever sum is the smaller, shall be payable as liquidated damages to the Carrier.
 
 (4)  The Merchant shall pay all dues, taxes and charges including consular fees levied on the Goods and
 all fines and/or losses sustained or incurred by the Carrier in connection with the laws and regulations
 of any government or public authorities in connection with the Goods.
 
 (5)  The shipper, consignor, consignee, owner and receiver of the Goods and holder of this Bill of Lading
 shall be jointly and severally liable to the Carrier for the payment of all freight and charges and for the
 performance of the obligation of each of them hereunder.
 
 25. LIEN    The Carrier shall have a lien on the Goods for freight, dead freight, salvage, general average, de-
 murrage or loss caused by detention, and for all payments made and liabilities incurred in respect of any
 charges or expenditures stipulated herein to be borne by the Merchant. The lien shall survive delivery of the
 Goods.
 
 26. GENERAL AVERAGE    Any general average on a Vessel operated by the Carrier shall be adjusted accord-
 ing to the York-Antwerp Rules, 1994 or any modification thereof at any port or place and in any currency
 at the option of the Carrier. Any general average on a vessel not operated by the Carrier (whether a sea-
 going or inland waterways vessel) shall be adjusted according to the requirements of the operator of that
 vessel. In either case the Merchant shall give such cash deposit or other security as the Carrier may deem
 sufficient to cover the estimated general average contribution of the Goods before delivery if the Carrier req-
 uires.
 
 27. NEW JASON CLAUSE / BOTH TO BLAME COLLISION CLAUSE    The New Jason Clause and the Both
 to Blame Collision Clause, as adopted by the Documentary Committee of The Japan Shipping Exchange,
 Inc. are deemed to be incorporated herein. These clauses are available from the Carrier on request.
 
 28.  US CLAUSE PARAMOUNT
 (1) If the carriage covered by this Bill of Lading includes carriage to or from a port or place in the United
 
 States of America, this Bill of Lading shall be subject to the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea
 Act 1936 (US COGSA), the terms of which are deemed to be incorporated herein and shall govern
 throughout the entire time during which the Goods are in the actual custody of the Carrier.
 
 (2) If US COGSA applies as (1) above, neither the Carrier nor the Vessel shall, in any event, be or be-
 come liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods in an amount exceeding
 $500.00 per package, lawful money of the United States, or in case the Goods are not shipped in
 packages, per customary freight unit unless the value of the Goods has been declared and inserted in
 the declared value box on the face hereof, in which case Clause 22(2) shall apply.

 agents, and the Master, and the Vessel and/or her Owner.
 ""Merchant"" includes the shipper, consignor, consignee, owner and receiver of the Goods and the
 
 holder of this Bill of Lading.
 ""Goods"" means the cargo described on the face hereof and, if the cargo is packed into container(s),
 
 loaded on pallet(s) or unitized into similar article(s) of transport not supplied or furnished by or on behalf of
 the Carrier, includes such article(s) of transport as well.
 
 ""Vessel"" means the Ocean Vessel named overleaf and includes any vessel, ship, craft, lighter or other
 means of transport by sea or water which is or shall be substituted, in whole or in part, for the vessel
 named on the face hereof.
 
   ""Sub-Contractor"" includes owners and operators of vessels and space providers on vessels  (other than
 the Carrier), stevedores, terminal and groupage operators, their respective servants and agents, and anyone
 assisting the performance of the carriage whomsoever.

 Goods by Sea Act, 1957 of Japan, as amended 3 June, 1992 giving effect to the Protocol to Amend
 the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to Bills of Lading, Brussels, February
 23, 1968 (Visby Rules) and the Protocol Amending the International Convention for the Unification of Certain
 Rules relating to Bills of Lading (August 25, 1924, as Amended by the Protocol of February 23, 1968), Brus-
 sels, December 21, 1979 (S.D.R. Protocol).

 and binding on both parties.
 
 4.   VALIDITY    In the event that anything herein contained is inconsistent with any applicable international
 convention or national law which cannot be departed from by private contract, the provisions hereof shall be
 null and void to the extent of such inconsistency but no further.
 
 5.   DEMISE CLAUSE    If the Vessel is not owned by, or chartered by demise to the Carrier (as may be the
 case notwithstanding anything that appears to the contrary) this Bill of Lading shall take effect only as a con-
 tract with the owner or demise charterer, as the case may be, as principal, made through the agency of the
 Carrier  which acts as agent only and shall be under no personal liability whatsoever in respect thereof. If de-
 spite the foregoing, it shall be adjudged that the Carrier and not the owner or demise charterer is a party to

 shall in no case exceed the limits provided for in this Bill of Lading.
 
 7.   PERIOD OF RESPONSIBILITY    The Carrier shall not be liable in any capacity whatsoever for any loss or
 damage to the Goods occurring before loading onto the Vessel at the Port of Loading or after discharge from
 the Vessel at the Port of Discharge, whether the Goods are awaiting shipment, landed or stored or put into
 craft, barge, lighter or other thing whether belonging to the Carrier or not or pending transhipment at any
 stage of the carriage.
 
 8.    SCOPE OF VOYAGE
 (1)  The Carrier has liberty to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property, to call at any port or ports

 sary supplies or for any other purpose whatsoever, to drydock with or without Goods on board if
 thought necessary or convenient, to adjust compasses, to sail without pilots, and to tow and assist
 ships in all situations and circumstances.
 
 (2)  Any action(s) taken by the Carrier under this Clause shall be deemed to be included within the scope
 of the contractual carriage and such action(s) or delay resulting therefrom shall not be deemed to be a

 nature, kind, value and any other particulars of the Goods have been furnished by the Merchant, and
 the Carrier shall not responsible for the accuracy thereof. The Merchant warrants to the Carrier
 that the particulars furnished by him are correct and shall indemnify the Carrier against all loss, dam-
 age, expenses, liability, penalties and fines arising out of or resulting from inaccuracy there of.
 
 (2)  If the cargo received by the Carrier is packed into container(s), loaded on pallet(s) or unitized into simi-
 lar article(s) of transport by or on behalf of the Merchant, this Bill of Lading is prima facie evidence
 only of the shipment of the number of such article(s) as shown on the face hereof; and the order and
 condition of the contents and the marks, numbers, number and kind of packages or pieces, descrip-
 tion, quality, quantity, gauge, measure, nature, kind and value noted on the face hereof are unknown
 to the Carrier. The Carrier shall accept no responsibility therefor.
 
 11.   MARKS AND DESCRIPTION
 (1)  The Carrier shall not be liable for failure of or delay in delivery in accordance with marks unless such
 
 marks shall have been clearly and durably stamped or marked upon the Goods or package(s) by the
 Merchant before shipment in letters and numbers not less than 5 centimeters high, together with the
 names of the port of discharge and/or destination.
 
 (2)  In no circumstances shall the Carrier be responsible for delivery in accordance with other than leading
 marks.
 
 (3)  The Merchant warrants to the Carrier that the marks on the Goods or package(s) correspond to the
 marks shown on this Bill of Lading and also in all respects comply with all laws and regulations in force
 at the port of discharge and/or destination, and shall indemnify the Carrier against all loss, damage, ex-
 penses, penalties and fines arising out of or resulting from incorrectness or incompleteness thereof.
 
 (4)  Goods which cannot be identified by marks and numbers, cargo sweepings, liquid residue and any
 unclaimed Goods not otherwise accounted for shall be allocated for the purpose of completing deliv-
 ery to the various merchants of goods of like character, in proportion to any apparent shortage, loss of
 weight or damage, and such Goods or parts thereof shall be accepted as full and complete delivery.
 
 12.  INSPECTION OF GOODS
 (1)  The Carrier shall be entitled, but under no obligation, to open any container or package at any time
 
 and to inspect, reweigh, remeasure, revalue or repack the Goods without notice to the Merchant.
 (2)  If paragraph (1) above applies or if by order of the authorities at any place, a container or package has
 
 to be opened, the Carrier will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of any opening, un-
 packing, inspection, reweighing, remeasurement, revaluation or repacking. The Merchant shall indem-
 nify the Carrier for the cost of all measures taken as above.
 
 13.  DECK CARGO
 (1)  The Carrier has the right to carry the Goods in container(s) under deck or on deck.
 (2)  When the Goods in container(s) are carried on deck, the Carrier shall not be required to specially note,
 
 mark or stamp any statement of ""on deck stowage"" on the face hereof, any custom to the contrary
 notwithstanding. The Goods so carried shall be subject to the applicable Hague Rules legislation as
 provided for in Clause 2 hereof, and the stowage of such Goods shall be deemed to constitute under
 deck stowage for all purposes including general average.
 
 (3)  The Carrier shall not be liable in any capacity whatsoever for any non-delivery, misdelivery, any delay
 or loss of or damage to the Goods which are carried on deck and specially stated herein to be so car-
 ried, whether or not caused by the Carrier's negligence or the Vessel's unseaworthiness.
 
 14. LIVE ANIMALS    Live animals are carried without responsibility on the part of the Carrier for any accident,
 injury, illness, death, loss or damage arising at any time whether caused by unseaworthiness or negligence
 or any other cause whatsoever.
 
 15.  DANGEROUS GOODS
 (1)  The Carrier undertakes to carry Goods of an explosive, inflammable, radioactive, corrosive, damaging,
 
 noxious, hazardous, poisonous, injurious or dangerous nature only upon the Carrier's acceptance of a
 prior written application by the Merchant for the carriage of such Goods.  Such application must accu-
 rately state the nature, name, label and classification of the Goods as well as the method of rendering
 them innocuous, with the full names and addresses of the shipper and the consignee.
 
 (2)  Whenever the Goods are discovered to have been shipped without complying with paragraph (1)
 above or the Goods are found to be contraband or prohibited by any laws or regulations of the port of
 loading, discharge or call or any place or waters during the carriage, the Carrier shall be entitled to
 have such Goods rendered innocuous, thrown overboard or discharged or otherwise disposed of at
 the Carrier's discretion without compensation and the Merchant shall be liable for and indemnify the
 Carrier against any kind of loss, damage or liability including loss of freight, and any expenses directly
 or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.
 
 (3)  The Carrier may exercise or enjoy the right or benefit conferred upon the Carrier under the preceding
 paragraph whenever it is apprehended that the Goods shipped in compliance with paragraph (1) above
 have become dangerous to the Carrier, the Vessel, other cargo, persons and/or other property.
 
 16. VALUABLE GOODS    The Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with plat-
 inum, gold, silver, jewellery, precious stones, other precious metals, radioisotopes, precious chemicals, cur-
 rency, negotiable instruments, securities, writings, documents, pictures, embroideries, works of art, curios,
 heirlooms, collections of every nature or any other valuable goods whatsoever including goods having par-
 ticular value only for the Merchant, unless the true nature and value of the Goods have been declared in
 writing by the Merchant before receipt of the Goods by the Carrier, and the same is inserted in this Bill of
 Lading and ad valorem freight has been prepaid thereon.
 
 17.  HEAVY LIFT
 (1)  The weight of a single piece or package exceeding 1 metric ton gross must be declared by the Mer-
 
 chant in writing before receipt by the Carrier.
 (2)  In case of the Merchant's failure to make the above declaration, the Carrier shall not be responsible
 
 for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods, and at the same time the Merchant
 shall be liable for loss of or damage to any property or for personal injury arising as a result of the
 
 Merchant's said failure and shall indemnify the Carrier against loss or liability of any kind suffered or
 incurred by the Carrier as a result of such failure.
 
 18. IRON AND STEEL    The term 'apparent external good order and condition' when used in this Bill of Lad-
 ing with reference to iron, steel or metal products does not mean that the Goods, when received, are free
 of visible rust or moisture. If the Merchant so requests, a substitute Bill of Lading will be issued omitting the
 above definition and setting forth any notation as to rust or moisture which may appear on the mates' or
 tally clerks' receipts.
 
 19.  DISCHARGE / DELIVERY
 (1)  The Goods may be discharged, without notice, as soon as the Vessel is ready to unload, continuously
 
 day and night, Sundays and holidays included.
 (2)  If the Merchant fails to take delivery of the Goods immediately after the Vessel is ready to discharge
 
 them, the Carrier shall be at liberty to store the Goods at the risk and expense of the Merchant.
 (3)  Optional delivery is only granted when arranged prior to the shipment of the Goods and expressed in
 
 this Bill of Lading. The Merchant desiring to avail himself of the option so expressed must give notice
 to the Carrier's agent at the first port of the Vessel's call named in the option, at least 48 hours prior
 to the Vessel's arrival there, otherwise the Goods shall be discharged at any of the optional ports at
 the Carrier's choice and the Carrier's responsibility shall then cease.
 
 (4)  If the Goods are unclaimed during a reasonable time, or whenever in the Carrier's judgement the
 Goods will become deteriorated, decayed or worthless, the Carrier may, at his discretion and without
 any responsibility attaching to him, sell, abandon or otherwise dispose of the Goods solely at the risk
 and expense of the Merchant.
 
 20.   TRANSHIPMENT
 (1)  (i) In case of through carriage under this Bill of Lading, the Merchant constitutes the Carrier his agents
 
 to enter into contracts with others for the pre-carriage and/or on-carriage of the Goods and/or for the
 storing, lightering, transhipment or other dealing therewith, prior to, or in the course of, or subsequent
 to the carriage in the Carrier's vessel without any liability attaching to him in respect of such agency.
 (ii) The responsibility of each carrier acting as such is limited to that part of the transport actually
 undertaken by him, and the Carrier shall not be under any liability for damage and/or loss arising from
 whatsoever cause during any other part of the transport, even though the freight for the whole trans-
 port has been collected by the Carrier.
 
 (2)  Any statement of the port or place, whether littoral or inland, ``in the column ""Final Destination"" on the
 face hereof is solely for the purpose of the Merchant's reference, and in case the columns ""(Local
 Vessel)"" and ""(From)"" on the face hereof are filled up and this Bill of Lading is issued at a place other
 than the port of loading onto the Vessel, any statement herein as to the shipment of the Goods shall
 be construed to relate only to the time when and place where the Goods were loaded on board the
 local vessel. The Carrier's liability, in those events, shall be determined in accordance with paragraph
 (1) of this Clause.
 
 (3)  The Carrier shall be at liberty, whether or not arranged beforehand or indicated on the face hereof, to
 tranship the whole or any part of the Goods, with or without notice, at any port or place for any pur-
 pose whatsoever, or to forward the same by any means of transport by water, land or air, whether
 owned or operated by the Carrier or not. The Carrier's liability shall, in this event, cease when the
 Goods leave the Vessel's tackle.
 
 21.  MATTERS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE
 (1)  The Carrier shall use reasonable endeavours to complete the transport and to deliver the goods at the
 
 place designated for delivery.
 (2)  If at any time the carriage is or is likely to be affected by any hindrance, risk, delay, difficulty, or dis-
 
 advantage of any kind and howsoever arising (even though the circumstances giving rise to such
 hindrance, risk, delay, difficulty or disadvantage existed at the time this contract was entered into or
 when the Goods were received for carriage), the Carrier (whether or not the carriage is commenced)
 may, without prior notice to the Merchant and at the sole discretion of the Carrier, either:
 
 (a)   Carry the Goods to the named Port of Discharge by an alternative route to that indicated in this Bill
 of Lading or that which is usual for Goods consigned to that Port of Discharge, (if the Carrier elects
 to invoke the terms of sub-paragraph (a), then notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 8 hereof,
 the Carrier shall be entitled to charge such additional freight as the Carrier may determine); or
 
 (b)   Suspend the carriage of the Goods and store them ashore or afloat upon the terms of this Bill of
 Lading and endeavour to forward them as soon as possible, but the Carrier makes no representa-
 tions as to the maximum period of suspension (if the Carrier elects to invoke the terms of Sub-para-
 graph (b) then the Carrier shall be entitled to such additional freight as the Carrier may determine); or
 
 (c)    Abandon the carriage of the Goods and place the Goods at the Merchant's disposal at any place or
 port which the Carrier may deem safe and convenient, whereupon the responsibility of the Carrier
 in respect of such Goods shall cease. The Carrier shall nevertheless be entitled to full freight on the
 Goods received for carriage, and the Merchant shall pay any additional costs of the carriage to, and
 delivery and storage at, such place or port. If the Carrier elects to use an alternative route under
 sub-paragraph (a) or to suspend the carriage under sub-paragraph (b) this shall not prejudice his right
 subsequently to abandon the carriage.
 
 (3)  The Carrier may comply with any orders or recommendations given by any government or authority,
 or any person acting or purporting to act as or on behalf of such government or authority, or having
 under the terms of any insurance on any conveyance employed by the Carrier the right to give orders
 or directions.
 
 22.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 (1)  When the Carrier is liable for compensation in respect of any loss of or damage to the Goods, such
 
 compensation shall be calculated by reference to the value of the Goods at the place and time they
 are discharged from the Vessel, or at the place and time they should have been discharged.
 
 For the purpose of determining the extent of the Carrier's liability for loss of or damage to the
 Goods, the value of the Goods is presumed to be the invoice value plus freight and insurance pre-
 mium, if paid.
 
 (2)  The Carrier shall in no event be liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods in
 an amount exceeding 666.67 Units of Account (Special Drawing Right) per package or unit or 2 Units
 of Account per kilogramme of gross weight of the Goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher,
 unless the value of the Goods is declared in writing by the shipper before shipment and the nature
 and value thereof is inserted in this Bill of Lading and extra freight is paid as agreed. In such case,
 even if the actual value of the Goods per package or unit exceeds such declared value, the value de-
 clared shall nevertheless be deemed to be the value of the Goods. The Carrier's liability shall not ex-
 ceed such declared value and any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the basis of
 such declared value.
 
 Where the cargo has been packed into container(s) or unitized into similar article(s) of transport
 by or on behalf of the Merchant, and when the number of packages or units packed into container(s)
 or unitized into similar article(s) of transport is not enumerated on the face thereof, each container or
 similar article including the entire contents thereof shall be considered as one package for the pur-
 pose of the application of the limitation of liability provided for herein.
 
 23.  NOTICE OF CLAIM AND TIME BAR
 (1)  Unless notice of loss of or damage to the Goods indicating the general nature of such loss or damage
 
 be given in writing to the Carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of removal
 of the Goods into the custody of the person entitled to take delivery thereof under this Bill of Lading
 or, if the loss or damage is not apparent, within three days of the delivery of the Goods, such removal
 or delivery shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the Carrier of the Goods in the amount and
 condition described in this Bill of Lading.
 
 (2)  In any event the Carrier shall be discharged from his liability for the Goods unless arbitration is filed
 pursuant to Clause 3(2) hereof within one year from the date of delivery of the Goods or the date
 when the Goods should have been delivered in the case of the total loss or non-delivery of the Goods.
 
 24.  FREIGHT AND CHARGES
 (1)  Freight and charges shall be deemed fully earned on receipt of the Goods by the Carrier and shall be
 
 paid in any event, whether the Vessel and/or the Goods be lost or not, or the transport be broken up
 or frustrated or abandoned at any stage of the entire transit.
 
 (2)  The payment of freight and/or charges shall be made in full and in cash without any offset, counter-
 claim or deduction. Where freight is payable at the port of discharge, destination or any other place,
 such freight and all other charges shall be paid in the currency named in this Bill of Lading or, at the
 Carrier's option, in other currency subject to the regulations of the freight conference concerned or
 custom at the place of payment.
 
 (3)  For the purpose of verifying the freight basis, the Carrier may at any time open any container or other
 package or unit in order to ascertain the weight, measurement or value of the Goods. If the particu-
 lars furnished by the Merchant are incorrect, it is agreed that a sum equal to either five times the dif-
 ference between the correct freight and the freight charged or to double the correct freight less the
 freight charged, whichever sum is the smaller, shall be payable as liquidated damages to the Carrier.
 
 (4)  The Merchant shall pay all dues, taxes and charges including consular fees levied on the Goods and
 all fines and/or losses sustained or incurred by the Carrier in connection with the laws and regulations
 of any government or public authorities in connection with the Goods.
 
 (5)  The shipper, consignor, consignee, owner and receiver of the Goods and holder of this Bill of Lading
 shall be jointly and severally liable to the Carrier for the payment of all freight and charges and for the
 performance of the obligation of each of them hereunder.
 
 25. LIEN    The Carrier shall have a lien on the Goods for freight, dead freight, salvage, general average, de-
 murrage or loss caused by detention, and for all payments made and liabilities incurred in respect of any
 charges or expenditures stipulated herein to be borne by the Merchant. The lien shall survive delivery of the
 Goods.
 
 26. GENERAL AVERAGE    Any general average on a Vessel operated by the Carrier shall be adjusted accord-
 ing to the York-Antwerp Rules, 1994 or any modification thereof at any port or place and in any currency
 at the option of the Carrier. Any general average on a vessel not operated by the Carrier (whether a sea-
 going or inland waterways vessel) shall be adjusted according to the requirements of the operator of that
 vessel. In either case the Merchant shall give such cash deposit or other security as the Carrier may deem
 sufficient to cover the estimated general average contribution of the Goods before delivery if the Carrier req-
 uires.
 
 27. NEW JASON CLAUSE / BOTH TO BLAME COLLISION CLAUSE    The New Jason Clause and the Both
 to Blame Collision Clause, as adopted by the Documentary Committee of The Japan Shipping Exchange,
 Inc. are deemed to be incorporated herein. These clauses are available from the Carrier on request.
 
 28.  US CLAUSE PARAMOUNT
 (1) If the carriage covered by this Bill of Lading includes carriage to or from a port or place in the United
 
 States of America, this Bill of Lading shall be subject to the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea
 Act 1936 (US COGSA), the terms of which are deemed to be incorporated herein and shall govern
 throughout the entire time during which the Goods are in the actual custody of the Carrier.
 
 (2) If US COGSA applies as (1) above, neither the Carrier nor the Vessel shall, in any event, be or be-
 come liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods in an amount exceeding
 $500.00 per package, lawful money of the United States, or in case the Goods are not shipped in
 packages, per customary freight unit unless the value of the Goods has been declared and inserted in
 the declared value box on the face hereof, in which case Clause 22(2) shall apply.

 Terms & Conditions
 
 Terms and conditions of the Carrier's Bill of Lading or Sea Waybill ( Contract of Carriage - available at https://www.msc.com/che/contract-of-carriage ) apply as from the issuance 
 
 of this Booking Confirmation as if incorporated by reference.
 
 1) Parties and Contract Terms
 This Booking Confirmation forms a contract between the Carrier and the Merchant as defined in the Contract of 
 Carriage.
 2) Description of Goods (see clauses 14 and 15 of the Contract of Carriage)
 Should the description of the Goods provided at the time of booking or as amended be inaccurate, the Merchant is 
 liable for all resulting increased charges, costs, expenses, losses and damages whatsoever.
 3) Goods, Packing and Container Weights:
 (a) Dangerous or hazardous Goods have been accepted by the Carrier in reliance of the Merchant s notice of their full 
 and true nature. The Merchant s dangerous or hazardous goods declarations must be in the format required by all 
 applicable regulations.
 (b) Goods include any packaging and any packing materials used to secure the cargo in the Container. It is the 
 Merchant's responsibility to ensure that packaging and packing materials, especially timber, comply with all 
 applicable requirements and
 their import is permitted in the country of destination. The weight of packaging and packing must be included in the 
 total weight declared for each Container.
 (c) Incorrectly declared weights of Goods directly affect the safety of the Vessel and all persons involved in the 
 transportation of the Goods and the Merchant must take care to properly evaluate the weight of the Goods.
 (d) Overloaded Containers are not permitted to be carried by law and the Merchant must not exceed the maximum 
 weight limit indicated on each Container. If the Merchant fails to comply with these provisions the Carrier reserves 
 the right to deal with such Goods as it sees fit including but not limited to not loading the Goods, stopping Goods 
 in transit, discharging at the next port and/or repacking them and levying extra charges, and the Merchant is strictly 
 liable to indemnify the Carrier for all costs, losses, delays, damages, fines, increased charges and any other 
 consequences whatsoever arising.
 4) Freight and Charges
 Freight and charges are based on the instructions provided at the date of this Booking Confirmation and may change 
 if the shipper's instructions change. Unless otherwise agreed in advance, the applicable tariff for freight and charges 
 for the Goods is the tariff in effect as at the date the Carrier takes possession of the Goods.
 The Carrier reserves the right to amend the freight and charges if the Carrier s tariff changes after the date hereof up 
 until the Carrier takes possession of the Goods.
 5) Use of Booking Agents
 Where the Merchant uses a booking agent, the Merchant warrants that the booking agent has the authority to enter 
 into this contract, receive original bills of lading and provide confirming instructions to the Carrier, until the 
 Merchant advises the Carrier otherwise in writing.
 
 6) Damage to Cargo Due to Atmospheric Conditions
 Save where Goods are carried in an operating refrigerated Container, the Carrier has no liability whatsoever for loss 
 or damage to the Goods caused by variations in atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
 7) Container Seal(s)
 Notwithstanding the provision of Container seal(s) by the Carrier, it is the Merchant's responsibility to ensure the 
 type of Seal affixed to the Container(s) is in compliance with all applicable regulations.
 8) Fumigation / Phytosanitary
 It is the Merchant s responsibility to provide fumigation and/or phytosanitary certificates in good time for 
 presentation to authorities as required and the Merchant is responsible for all consequences of failing to do so.
 9) Extra Charges
 The Merchant is advised that extra charges may be levied by local authorities in addition to the freight and charges 
 listed on Page 1 or described in the Carrier s tariff and payable before the Goods can be delivered. The Carrier may 
 be required to collect the extra charges on behalf of the local authorities.
 10) Sanctions and Import/Export Control Laws
 It is the Merchant s responsibility to ensure that this Booking Confirmation complies with all applicable trade 
 sanctions and import/export control laws ( Sanctions ). The Merchant is strictly liable to indemnify the Carrier for all 
 costs, losses, damages and consequences whatsoever arising out of any failure by the Merchant to comply with 
 Sanctions. Carrier reserves the right to ensure compliance with Sanctions applicable to the Carrier.
 11) Sending of Bills of Lading and Sea Waybills
 Bills of Lading or Sea Waybills will be available for the Merchant to collect from the MSC Agency office, but 
 should the Merchant request them to be sent, this shall be at the Merchant s own risk and expense. Carrier and MSC 
 Agency accept no liability whatsoever.
 12) Mode of Transport, Vessel, and Voyage Number
 The information provided in these fields is anticipated at the time of the booking. Carrier reserves the right to 
 change any of them.
 13) Late Customs Declaration Fines
 When it is the Merchant's responsibility to file customs declarations and the Carrier is fined in consequence of the 
 Merchant's late, incomplete or erroneous filing the Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier for the fine and for all costs, 
 losses and expenses whatsoever incidental thereto.
 14) Contract of Carriage
 The information furnished on this Booking Confirmation will be used to issue the Contract of Carriage.
 
 Sauf convention contraire et exprès, le prix des transports et services commandés est dû et payable en totalité dès 
 l'émission du bill of lading par MSC et/ou MSC France
 
 Poids de la cargaison déclarée et cargaison en surpoids
 MSC n'autorise pas l'utilisation de ses conteneurs de quelque manière que ce soit pour soulever, charger, déplacer ou 
 transporter des marchandises qui :
 a. sont déclarées à tort
 b. pèsent plus que le VGM ou le poids commercial / manifeste déclaré, 
 c. pèsent plus que la charge utile de l'équipement.
 Si MSC devait être informé, avant ou pendant le transport, que ses conteneurs ont été utilisés en violation de l'une 
 des interdictions ci-dessus, le ou les conteneurs concernés peuvent être refusés pour le chargement, conservés à bord 
 pour le retour vers le port d'origine, déchargés au prochain port permettant d’apporter des mesures correctives, comme 
 par exemple, procéder à un dépotage/ré-empotage. Ces mesures seront prises à la seule discrétion de MSC, et aux 
 seuls risques et frais du marchand.
 Le marchand est responsable vis-à-vis de MSC et de ses agents de toutes pertes, réclamations, amendes, demandes, 
 poursuites et actions de toute nature que ce soit, y compris en cas de décès et de dommages corporels, des frais 
 juridiques et judiciaires, directement ou indirectement résultant de l’utilisation non autorisée des conteneurs de MSC.
 Tout travail supplémentaire généré en raison d'une violation de l'une des interdictions ci-dessus donnera lieu à une 
 facturation ad hoc et MSC se réserve le droit d'exercer son privilège sur la cargaison litigieuse et/ou toute autre 
 marchandise transportée pour le compte du marchand jusqu’à ce  MSC soit entièrement payés de ses coûts.
 Les dispositions ci-dessus s’appliquent également aux conteneurs appartenant aux marchands (shipper’s owned 
 containers) ou à l’équipement remis au transporteur pour l’expédition.
 
 Declared cargo’s weight and overweight cargo
 MSC does not permit its Containers to be used in any manner whatsoever to lift, load, move or 
 carry cargoes that: 
 a. are wrongly declared, or 
 b. weigh in excess of the VGM or commercial / manifest weight declared, or
 c. weigh in excess of the payload of the equipment. 
 Should MSC be made aware, prior or during carriage, that its Containers have been used in breach of any of the 
 above prohibitions, the container(s) concerned may be refused for loading, kept onboard for return to origin, 
 discharged at the next convenient port and/or corrective measures such as, but not limited to, restuffing into other

 5. CARRIER'S RESPONSIBILITY
 
 5.1 Port-to-Port carriage - If carriage under this Bill of Lading is Port-to-Port:
 
 (a) The period of responsibility of the Carrier for any loss of or damage to the Goods shall commence only at the moment that the Goods are loaded on board the Vessel and shall end when the Goods have been discharged from the Vessel.
 
 (b) This Bill of Lading shall be subject to the Hague Rules unless the governing law makes the Hague or the Hague-Visby Rules compulsorily applicable in which case the said Hague or Hague-Visby Rules will apply to this Bill of Lading only to the extent that they are compulsorily applicable.
 
 (c) Notwithstanding the above, in case and to the extent that the governing law, or a contractual arrangement, or custom and practice, or any court or tribunal decision extends the Carrier's period of responsibility whether in contract, tort, bailment or otherwise to all or any part of the period before loading, or the period after discharge, including for misdelivery, then Carrier shall have the benefit of every right, defence, immunity, limitation and liberty 
 
 provided for in the Hague Rules during such additional period of responsibility, notwithstanding that the loss, damage or misdelivery did not occur during the carriage by sea.
 
 5.2 Combined Transport - The Carrier's liability for Combined Transport shall be as follows: 5.2.1 Where the loss or damage occurred during the Port-to-Port section of the carriage, the liability of the Carrier is in accordance with clause 5.1 above.
 
 5.2.2 Where the loss or damage occurred during Inland Transport, the liability of the Carrier shall be determined:
 
 (a) by the provisions contained in any international convention, national law or regulation applicable to the means of transport utilized, if such convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable in the case where a separate contract had been made in respect to the particular stage of transport concerned, or
 
 (b) where no international convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable, by the contract of carriage issued by the Subcontractor carrier for that stage of transport, including any limitations and exceptions contained therein, which contract the Merchant and the Carrier adopt and incorporate by reference, it being agreed that the Carrier's rights and liabilities shall be the same as those of the Subcontractor carrier, but in 
 
 no event whatsoever shall the Carrier's liability exceed GBP 100 sterling legal tender per package, or
 
 (c) if any court shall determine that no international convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable and that the Carrier may not determine its liability, if any, by reference to the applicable Subcontractor's contract of carriage or where said Subcontractor carrier does not have a contract of carriage, then it is contractually agreed as between the Merchant and the Carrier that the Carrier's liability shall be determined as if 
 
 the loss and/or damage complained of occurred during the Port-to-Port section of carriage as provided at 5.1 above, but in no event whatsoever shall the Carrier's liability exceed GBP 100 sterling legal tender per package.
 
 (d) If the place of loss or damage cannot be established by the Merchant, then the loss or damage shall be presumed to have occurred during the Port-to-Port section of carriage and the Carrier's liability shall be determined as provided at 5.1 above.
 
 5.2.3 Any transport that the Carrier arranges for the Merchant which is not part of the carriage under this Bill of Lading is done under the Merchant's own responsibility, time, risk and expense and the Carrier acts as agent only for the Merchant.

 Goods by the Carrier to the Merchant and the Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to the Goods which occurs for any reason whatsoever after delivery of the Goods by the Carrier to the customs or port authorities.
 
 6. U.S. TRADE CLAUSE
 
 6.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 5, for carriage to or from any port of the United States, its territories or possessions, or if suit is brought in the United States, this Bill of Lading shall have effect subject to the provisions of the COGSA and to the provisions of the Pomerene Act regardless of whether said Act would apply of its own force. The provisions of the COGSA are incorporated herein and save as otherwise provided herein shall 
 
 apply throughout the entire time the Goods are in the Carrier's custody, including before loading and after discharge as long as the Goods remain in the custody of the Carrier or its Subcontractors, including cargo carried on deck. Nothing contained herein is to be deemed a surrender by the Carrier of its rights, immunities, exemptions or limitations or an increase of any of its responsibilities or liabilities under the COGSA. Except for clause 5, every 
 
 other term, condition, limitation, defence and liberty whatsoever contained in this Bill of Lading shall apply to carriage in the US Trades.
 
 6.2 For limitation purposes under the COGSA, it is agreed that the meaning of the word ""package"" shall be any palletised and/or unitised assemblage of cartons which has been palletised and/or unitised for the convenience of the Merchant, regardless of whether said pallet or unit is disclosed on the front hereof.
 
 7. COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY PROVISIONS
 
 7.1 Subject always to the Carrier's right to limit liability as provided for herein, if the Carrier is liable for compensation in respect of loss of or damage to the Goods, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the invoice value of the Goods, plus Freight and insurance if paid. If there is no invoice value of the Goods or if any such invoice is not bona fide, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the market value of such 
 
 Goods at the place and time they are delivered or should have been delivered to the Merchant. The market value of the Goods shall be fixed according to the current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and/or quality.
 
 7.2 Save as is provided in clause 7.3:
 
 7.2.1 (a) If and to the extent the Hague Rules or Hague-Visby Rules are compulsorily applicable to this Bill of Lading by virtue of clauses 5.1, 5.2.1 or 5.2.2 (c) or (d) or otherwise, the Carrier's liability for breaches or wrongs occurring during such period of compulsory application shall in no event whatsoever exceed the amounts provided in the Hague Rules or Hague-Visby Rules, whichever are compulsorily applicable.
 
 (b) If and to the extent the Hague Rules apply only contractually pursuant to clause 5, the Carrier's maximum liability shall in no event whatsoever exceed GBP 100 sterling lawful currency per package or unit.
 
 7.2.2 Where COGSA applies by virtue of clause 6, neither the Carrier nor the Vessel shall in any event be or become liable in an amount exceeding US$500 per package or per customary freight unit.
 
 7.3 The Merchant agrees and acknowledges that the Carrier has no knowledge of the value of the Goods. Higher compensation than that provided for in this Bill of Lading may be claimed only when, with the written confirmation of the Carrier, the value of the Goods declared by the Shipper upon delivery to the Carrier has been stated by the Carrier in the box marked ""Declared Value"" on the front of this Bill of Lading and ad valorem charges paid. In 
 
 that case, the amount of the Declared Value shall be substituted for the limits provided in this Bill of Lading. Any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the basis of such Declared Value.
 
 7.4 Nothing in this Bill of Lading shall operate to limit or deprive the Carrier of any statutory protection, defence, exemption or limitation of liability authorised by any applicable laws, statutes or regulations of any country or which would have been applicable in the absence of any of the terms set out in this Bill of Lading. The Carrier shall have the benefit of the said laws, statutes or regulations as if it were the owner of the Vessel.
 
 7.5 When any claim is paid by the Carrier to the Merchant, the Carrier shall be automatically subrogated to all rights of the Merchant against any third party. The Merchant shall sign a subrogation receipt, release and indemnity immediately when requested by the Carrier.
 
 8. SCOPE OF VOYAGE, DELAY, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
 
 The scope of voyage herein contracted for may or may not include usual or customary or advertised ports of call whether named in this Bill of Lading contract or not and may include transport of the Goods to or from any facilities used by the Carrier as part of the carriage, including but not limited to off-dock storage. The Carrier does not promise or undertake to load, carry or discharge the Goods on or by any particular Vessel, date or time. Advertised 
 
 sailings and arrivals are only estimated times, and such schedules may be advanced, delayed or cancelled without notice. In no event shall the Carrier be liable for consequential damages or for any delay in scheduled departures or arrivals of any Vessel or other conveyances used to transport the Goods by sea or otherwise. If the Carrier should nevertheless be held legally liable for any such direct or indirect or consequential loss or damage 
 
 caused by such alleged delay, such liability shall in no event exceed the Freight paid for the carriage.
 
 9. METHODS AND ROUTES OF CARRIAGE
 
 9.1 The Carrier may at any time and without notice to the Merchant:
 
 (a) use any means of transport or storage whatsoever;
 
 (b) transfer the Goods from one conveyance to another including transhipping or carrying the Goods on a Vessel other than the Vessel named on the front hereof or by any other means of transport whatsoever, even though transhipment or forwarding of the Goods by such means may not have been contemplated or provided for herein;

 (d) load and unload the Goods at any place or port (whether or not any such port is named on the front hereof as the Port of Loading or Port of Discharge) and store the Goods at any such port or place, including but not limited to the use of off-dock storage at any port;
 
 (e) comply with any orders or recommendations given by any government or authority or any Person or body purporting to act as or on behalf of such government or authority or having under the terms of the insurance on any conveyance employed by the Carrier the right to give orders or directions.

 10. NOTICE OF CLAIMS, TIME BAR AND JURISDICTION
 
 10.1 Notice - of loss or damage to Goods shall be given in writing to the Carrier or its agent at the Port of Discharge before or at the time of delivery. If the loss or damage is not apparent before or at the time of delivery, notice must be given within three (3) days of delivery to the Merchant or its agent. Claims shall be submitted in writing addressed by the Merchant to the Carrier's agent at the Port of Discharge.
 
 10.2 Time bar - In any event, the Carrier shall be discharged from all liability if suit is not commenced within one (1) year after delivery of the Goods or the date that the Goods should have been delivered for claims related to loss or damage during the Port-to-Port carriage, and for claims related to loss or damage during Inland Transport the shorter of nine (9) months or any time limit provided for by any applicable international convention, national law, 
 
 regulation or contract by virtue of clauses 5.2.2 (a) or (b).
 
 10.3 Jurisdiction - It is hereby specifically agreed that any suit by the Merchant, and save as additionally provided below any suit by the Carrier, shall be filed exclusively in the High Court of London and English Law shall exclusively apply, unless the carriage contracted for hereunder was to or from the United States of America, in which case suit shall be filed exclusively in the United States District Court, for the Southern District of New York 
 
 and U.S. law shall exclusively apply. The Merchant agrees that it shall not institute suit in any other court and agrees to be responsible for the reasonable legal expenses and costs of the Carrier in removing a suit filed in another forum. The Merchant waives any objection to the personal jurisdiction over the Merchant of the above agreed fora.
 
 In the case of any dispute relating to Freight or other sums due from the Merchant to the Carrier, the Carrier may, at its sole option, bring suit against the Merchant in the fora agreed above, or in the countries of the Port of Loading, Port of Discharge, Place of Delivery or in any jurisdiction where the Merchant has a place of business.
 
 11. MERCHANT-PACKED CONTAINERS
 
 If a Container has not been packed by or on behalf of the Carrier:

 11.2 The Carrier shall not be liable for loss of or damage to the Goods caused by:
 
 (a) the manner in which the Goods have been packed, stowed, stuffed or secured in the Container, or
 
 (b) the unsuitability of the Goods for carriage in the Container supplied or for carriage by Container between the Ports or Places specified herein, or
 
 (c) the unsuitability or defective condition of the Container or the incorrect setting of any refrigeration controls thereof, provided that, if the Container has been supplied by or on behalf of the Carrier, this unsuitability or defective condition would have been apparent upon inspection by the Merchant at or prior to the time when the Container was packed, or
 
 (d) packing refrigerated Goods that are not properly pre-cooled to the correct temperature for carriage or before the refrigerated Container has been properly pre-cooled to the correct carrying temperature.
 
 11.3 The Merchant is responsible for the packing and sealing of all Merchant-packed Containers and, if a Merchant-packed Container is delivered by the Carrier with an original seal as affixed by the Merchant or customs or security control intact, or the Carrier can establish bona fide circumstances in which the original seal was replaced, the Carrier shall not be liable for any shortage of Goods ascertained upon delivery.
 
 11.4 The Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier against any loss, damage, liability or expense whatsoever and howsoever arising caused by one or more of the matters referred to in clause 11. 2, including but not limited to damage to Container, other cargo and the Vessel.
 
 12. REFRIGERATION, HEATING, INSULATION
 
 12.1 Special Containers with refrigeration, heating or insulation shall not be furnished unless contracted for on the front of this Bill of Lading and extra Freight paid. If a carrying temperature is noted on the front of this Bill of Lading, the Merchant shall deliver the Goods to the Carrier at plus or minus 2 degrees Celsius from the noted temperature, and the Carrier shall exercise due diligence to maintain such supply air temperature, plus or minus 2 
 
 degrees Celsius while the Goods are in its possession. IT IS THE MERCHANT'S OBLIGATION TO SET AND/OR CHECK THAT THE TEMPERATURE CONTROLS ON THE CONTAINER ARE AT THE REQUIRED CARRYING TEMPERATURE AND TO PROPERLY SET THE VENTS. The Carrier does not undertake to deliver empty refrigerated Containers to the Merchant at any specific temperature. The Carrier has the right but not the 
 
 obligation to refuse to accept any Container loaded by the Merchant for shipment where the Goods are not or were not loaded into the Container within plus or minus 2 degrees Celsius of the contracted carrying temperature.
 
 12.2 The Merchant must take note that refrigerated Containers are not designed:
 
 (a) to cool or freeze Goods which have been loaded into a Container at a temperature higher than their designated carrying temperature. The Carrier shall not be responsible for the consequences of the Goods being loaded at a higher temperature than that required for the carriage; nor
 
 (b) to monitor and control humidity levels, even if a setting facility exists, and because humidity is influenced by many external factors the Carrier does not guarantee and is not responsible for the maintenance of any intended level of humidity inside any Container.
 
 12.3 The Carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage to the Goods arising from latent defects, breakdown, defrosting, stoppage of the refrigerating or any other specialised machinery, plant, insulation and/or apparatus of the Container and any other facilities, provided that the Carrier exercised due diligence before releasing the empty Container to the Shipper.
 
 12.4 The Carrier does not warrant refrigeration or heating machinery, but shall exercise care in its operation and maintenance while in the actual possession of the Carrier. The Carrier will not accept responsibility for the recording of temperatures in any form other than any reefer log book maintained on board the Vessel. The Carrier does not accept to comply with any governmental program or protocol unless noted on the front hereof and additional 
 
 Freight is paid.
 
 13. INSPECTION OF GOODS AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
 
 Inspection - The Carrier shall be entitled, but shall be under no obligation, to open and/or scan any package or Container at any time and to inspect, verify and weigh the contents without notice to the Merchant.
 
 Special circumstances - If it appears at any time that the Goods cannot safely or properly be carried or carried further, either at all or without incurring any additional expense or taking any measures in relation to the Container or the Goods, the Carrier may without notice to the Merchant (but as his agent only) take any measures and/or incur any reasonable additional expense to carry or to continue the carriage of the Goods, and/or to sell or dispose of 
 
 them and/or to abandon the carriage and/or to store them ashore or afloat, under cover or in the open, at any place, whichever the Carrier in its absolute discretion considers most appropriate, and any sale, disposal, abandonment or storage shall be deemed to constitute due delivery under this Bill of Lading. The Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier against any additional expense so incurred. The Carrier in exercising the liberties contained in this 
 
 clause shall not be under any obligation to take any particular measures and shall not be liable for any loss, delay or damage howsoever arising from any action or lack of action under this clause.
 
 14. DESCRIPTION OF GOODS AND MERCHANT'S RESPONSIBILITY
 
 14.1 This Bill of Lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the Carrier in apparent good order and condition, except as otherwise noted, of the total number of Containers or other packages or units indicated in the box entitled ""Carriers Receipt"" on the front hereof.
 
 14.2 No representation is made by the Carrier as to the weight, contents, measure, quantity, quality, description, condition, temperature, marks, numbers or value of the Goods and the Carrier shall be under no responsibility whatsoever in respect of such description or particulars.
 
 14.3 The Merchant warrants to the Carrier that the particulars relating to the Goods as set out on the front hereof have been checked by or on behalf of the Merchant on receipt of this Bill of Lading and that such particulars, and any other particulars furnished by or on behalf of the Merchant, are adequate and correct. The Merchant warrants that the Goods are safely and securely packed in the Container.
 
 14.4. The Merchant also warrants that the Goods and/or Merchant-packed Containers are lawful Goods, contain no contraband, drugs, other illegal substances or stowaways, and that any hazardous or potentially dangerous characteristics of the Goods have been fully disclosed by or on behalf of the Merchant and that they will not cause loss, damage or expense to the Carrier, or to any other cargo, Containers, Vessel or Person during the carriage.
 
 14.5 If any particulars of any letter of credit and/or import license and/or sales contract and/or invoice or order number and/or details of any contract to which the Carrier is not a party are shown on the front hereof, such particulars are shown at the sole risk of the Merchant and for his convenience. The Merchant agrees that such particulars shall not be regarded as a declaration of value and shall in no circumstances whatsoever increase the Carrier's 
 
 liability under this Bill of Lading, and the Merchant agrees to indemnify the Carrier for any increased liability so caused, including reasonable legal expenses and costs.
 
 14.6 The Merchant shall comply with all regulations or requirements of customs, port and other authorities, and shall bear and pay all duties, taxes, fines, imposts, expenses or losses (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing Freight for any additional carriage undertaken), incurred or suffered by reason thereof, or by reason of any illegal, incorrect or insufficient declaration, marking, numbering or addressing of the Goods, and shall 
 
 indemnify the Carrier in respect thereof, including reasonable legal expenses and costs.
 
 14.7 If by order of the authorities at any place, Goods are detained and/or seized and/or a Container has to be opened for the Goods to be inspected for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to for a breach or infringement of a trademark, patent or other intellectual property right, the Carrier will not be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever incurred as a result of any opening, unpacking, inspection, re-packing, detention, destruction or 
 
 delay. The Carrier shall be entitled to recover from the Merchant all charges, fines, costs, losses and expenses, including reasonable legal expenses and costs resulting from such action, including but not limited to any detention, demurrage and storage charges for the Goods and/or the Container.
 
 14.8 The Carrier allows a period of free time for the use of the Containers and other equipment in accordance with the Tariff and as advised by the local MSC agent at the Ports of Loading and Discharge. Free time commences from the day the Container and other equipment is collected by the Merchant or is discharged from the Vessel or is delivered to the Place of Delivery as the case may be. The Merchant is required and has the responsibility to 
 
 return to a place nominated by the Carrier the Container and other equipment before or at the end of the free time allowed at the Port of Discharge or the Place of Delivery. Demurrage, per diem and detention charges will be levied and payable by the Merchant thereafter in accordance with the Tariff.
 
 14.9 The Merchant shall redeliver, to a place nominated by the Carrier, the Containers and other equipment in like good order and condition, undamaged, empty, odour free, cleaned and with all fittings installed by the Merchant removed and without any rubbish, dunnage or other debris inside. The Merchant shall be liable to indemnify the Carrier for any and all costs incurred reinstating or replacing Containers and other equipment not returned in the 
 
 condition as specified above, including the reasonable legal expenses and costs of recovering the costs incurred and interest thereon.
 
 16. FREIGHT AND CHARGES
 
 16.1 Freight has been calculated on the basis of the Shipper's particulars and if such particulars are found to be erroneous and additional Freight is payable, the Merchant shall be liable therefor and also for any expense thereby incurred.
 
 16.2 All Freight is earned and due upon receipt of the Goods by the Carrier, whether the Freight is prepaid or collect and the Carrier shall be entitled to all Freight due under all circumstances, ship and/or cargo lost or not lost or the voyage abandoned. All Freight shall be paid when due without any set-off, counter claim, or deduction.
 
 16.3 Every Person defined as ""Merchant"" in clause 1 shall be jointly and severally liable to the Carrier for the payment of all Freight and charges and for the performance of the obligations of each of them hereunder. Any Person engaged by the Merchant to perform forwarding services with respect to the Goods shall be considered to be exclusively the Merchant's agent for all purposes, and any payment of Freight to such Person shall not be 
 
 considered payment to the Carrier in any event whatsoever. Failure of such third parties to pay any part of the Freight to the Carrier shall be considered a default by the Merchant in the payment of Freight.
 
 17. CARRIER'S LIEN
 
 The Carrier, its servants or agents shall have a lien on the Goods and any document relating thereto for Freight and for general average contributions to whomsoever due. The Carrier, its servants or agents shall also have a lien against the Merchant on the Goods and any document relating thereto for all sums due from the Merchant to the Carrier under any other contract. The Carrier may exercise its lien at any time and any place in its sole 
 
 discretion, through the action of any servant, agent or Subcontractor, whether the contractual carriage is completed or not. The Carrier's lien shall also extend to cover the cost and legal expense of recovering any sums due. The Carrier shall have the right to sell any Goods liened by public auction or private treaty, without notice to the Merchant. Nothing herein shall prevent the Carrier from recovering from the Merchant the difference between the 
 
 amount due to the Carrier and the net amount realised by such sale.
 
 18. OPTIONAL STOWAGE, DECK CARGO AND LIVESTOCK
 
 18.1 Goods, whether packed in Containers or not, may be carried on deck or under deck without notice to the Merchant unless it is specifically stipulated on the front hereof that the Containers or Goods will be carried under deck. If carried on deck, the Carrier shall not be required to note, mark or stamp on the Bill of Lading any statement of such on-deck carriage. Save as provided in clause 18.2 such Goods (except livestock) carried on or under 
 
 deck and whether or not stated to be carried on deck shall participate in general average and shall be deemed to be within the definition of Goods for the purpose of the Hague Rules or the COGSA or any compulsorily applicable legislation and shall be carried subject to such Rules or Act, whichever is applicable.
 
 18.2. Goods which are out of gauge and/or are stowed on or in open top containers, flatracks or platforms, and which are stated on the front hereof to be carried on deck, and all livestock whether carried on deck or under deck, are carried without any responsibility whatsoever on the part of the Carrier for loss or damage of whatsoever nature or delay arising during the carriage whether caused by unseaworthiness or negligence or any other cause 
 
 whatsoever and the Hague Rules or the COGSA shall not apply.
 
 19. MATTERS ADVERSELY AFFECTING CARRIER'S PERFORMANCE
 
 19.1 If at any time the carriage is or is likely to be affected by any hindrance, risk, danger, delay, difficulty or disadvantage of whatsoever kind and howsoever arising which cannot be avoided by the Carrier by the exercise of reasonable endeavours, (even though the circumstances giving rise to such hindrance, risk, danger, delay, difficulty or disadvantage existed at the time this contract was entered into or the Goods were received for the carriage) 
 
 the Carrier may at its sole discretion and without notice to the Merchant and whether or not the carriage is commenced either:
 
 (a) carry the Goods to the contracted Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery, whichever is applicable, by an alternative route to that indicated in this Bill of Lading or that which is usual for Goods consigned to that Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery; or
 
 (b) suspend the carriage of the Goods and store them ashore or afloat upon the terms and conditions of this Bill of Lading and endeavour to forward them as soon as possible, but the Carrier makes no representations as to the maximum period of suspension; or
 
 (c) abandon the carriage of the Goods and place them at the Merchant's disposal at any place or port which the Carrier may deem safe and convenient, or from which the Carrier is unable by the exercise of reasonable endeavours to continue the carriage, whereupon the responsibility of the Carrier in respect of such Goods shall cease. The Carrier shall nevertheless be entitled to full Freight on the Goods received for the carriage, and the Merchant 
 
 shall pay any additional costs incurred by reason of the abandonment of the Goods. If the Carrier elects to use an alternative route under clause 19.1 (a) or to suspend the carriage under clause 19.1 (b) this shall not prejudice its right subsequently to abandon the carriage.
 
 19.2 If the Carrier elects to invoke the terms of this clause 19, then notwithstanding the provisions of clause 9, the Carrier shall be entitled to such additional Freight and costs as the Carrier may determine.
 
 20. NOTIFICATION AND DELIVERY
 
 20.1 Any mention in this Bill of Lading of parties to be notified of the arrival of the Goods is solely for information of the Carrier. Failure to give such notification shall not subject the Carrier to any liability nor relieve the Merchant of any obligation hereunder.
 
 20.2 The Merchant shall take delivery of the Goods within the time provided for in the Carrier's applicable Tariff or as otherwise agreed. If the Merchant fails to do so, the Carrier may without notice unpack the Goods if packed in Containers and/or store the Goods ashore, afloat, in the open or under cover at the sole risk of the Merchant. Such storage shall constitute due delivery hereunder, and thereupon all liability whatsoever of the Carrier in 
 
 respect of the Goods, including for misdelivery or non-delivery, shall cease and the costs of such storage shall forthwith upon demand be paid by the Merchant to the Carrier.
 
 20.3 If the Goods are unclaimed within a reasonable time or whenever in the Carrier's opinion the Goods are likely to deteriorate, decay or become worthless, or incur charges whether for storage or otherwise in excess of their value, the Carrier may at its discretion and without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the Merchant, without notice and without any responsibility attaching to it, sell, abandon or otherwise dispose of the 
 
 Goods at the sole risk and expense of the Merchant and apply any proceeds of sale in reduction of the sums due to the Carrier from the Merchant under or in connection with this Bill of Lading.
 
 20.4 Refusal by the Merchant to take delivery of the Goods in accordance with the terms of this clause and/or to mitigate any loss or damage thereto shall constitute an absolute waiver and abandonment by the Merchant to the Carrier of any claim whatsoever relating to the Goods or the carriage thereof. The Carrier shall be entitled to an indemnity from the Merchant for all costs whatsoever incurred, including legal costs, for the cleaning and 
 
 disposal of Goods refused and/or abandoned by the Merchant.
 
 21. BOTH TO BLAME COLLISION CLAUSE
 
 If the Vessel comes into collision with another ship as a result of the negligence of the other ship and any act, neglect or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the Carrier in the navigation or in the management of the Vessel, the owners of the Goods carried hereunder will indemnify the Carrier against all loss or liability to the other or non-carrying ship or her owners in so far as such loss or liability represents loss of, or damage to, or 
 
 any claim whatsoever of the owners of said Goods, paid or payable by the other or non-carrying ship or her owners to the owners of said Goods and set-off, recouped or recovered by the other or non-carrying ship or her owners as part of their claim against the Vessel or Carrier. The foregoing provisions shall also apply where the owners, operators or those in charge of any ship or ships or objects other than, or in addition to, the colliding ships or 
 
 objects are at fault in respect of a collision or contact.
 
 22. GENERAL AVERAGE AND SALVAGE
 
 General Average shall be adjusted, stated and settled at any port or place at the Carrier's option according to York - Antwerp Rules 1994 except Rule XXII and, as to matters not therein provided for, according to the laws and usages at any port or place at the Carrier's option. General Average on a Vessel not operated by the Carrier shall be adjusted according to the requirements of the operator of that Vessel. Average agreement or bond and such 
 
 cash deposit (payable at Carrier's option in United States currency) as the Carrier may require as additional security for the contribution of the Goods and salvage and special charges thereon, shall be furnished before delivery or forwarding.
 
 In the event of accident, danger, damage or disaster, before or after commencement of the voyage resulting from any cause whatsoever, whether due to negligence or not, for which, or for the consequence of which, the Carrier is not responsible by statute, contract, or otherwise, the Goods and the Merchant shall, jointly and severally, contribute with the Carrier in General Average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses, or expenses of a General 
 
 Average nature that may be made or incurred, and shall pay salvage and special charges incurred in respect of the Goods, as determined by an independent General Average adjuster duly appointed by the Carrier, and his determination as to liability for General Average contribution and his computation for the same shall be final and binding on all parties to the venture. If a salving ship is owned or operated by the Carrier, salvage shall be paid for as 
 
 fully and in the same manner as if such salvaging ship or ships belonged to strangers. Such deposit as the Carrier or its agents may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the goods and any salvage and special charges thereon shall, if required, be made by the Goods, Shippers, Consignees or owners of the Goods to the Carrier before delivery.
 
 23. SEPARABILITY AND VARIATION OF TERMS, FINAL CONTRACT
 
 The terms of this Bill of Lading shall be separable and, if any term or provision hereof or any part of any term or provision shall be invalid to any extent, it shall be invalid to that extent, but no further and such circumstance shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other term or provision hereof. This Bill of Lading is the final contract between the parties which supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, whether in writing or verbal, save

 5. CARRIER'S RESPONSIBILITY
 
 5.1 Port-to-Port carriage - If carriage under this Sea Waybill is Port-to-Port:
 
 (a) The period of responsibility of the Carrier for any loss of or damage to the Goods shall commence only at the moment that the Goods are loaded on board the Vessel and shall end when the Goods have been discharged from the Vessel.
 
 (b) This Sea Waybill shall be subject to the Hague Rules unless the governing law makes the Hague or the Hague-Visby Rules compulsorily applicable in which case the said Hague or Hague-Visby Rules will apply to this Sea Waybill only to the extent that they are compulsorily applicable.
 
 (c) Notwithstanding the above, in case and to the extent that the governing law, or a contractual arrangement, or custom and practice, or any court or tribunal decision extends the Carrier's period of responsibility whether in contract, tort, bailment or otherwise to all or any part of the period before loading, or the period after discharge, including for misdelivery, then the Carrier shall have the benefit of every right, defence, immunity, limitation and liberty 
 
 provided for in the Hague Rules during such additional period of responsibility, notwithstanding that the loss, damage or misdelivery did not occur during the carriage by sea.
 
 5.2 Combined Transport - The Carrier's liability for Combined Transport shall be as follows:
 
 5.2.1 Where the loss or damage occurred during the Port-to-Port section of the carriage, the liability of the Carrier is in accordance with clause 5.1 above.
 
 5.2.2 Where the loss or damage occurred during Inland Transport, the liability of the Carrier shall be determined:
 
 (a) by the provisions contained in any international convention, national law or regulation applicable to the means of transport utilized, if such convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable in the case where a separate contract had been made in respect to the particular stage of transport concerned, or
 
 (b) where no international convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable, by the contract of carriage issued by the Subcontractor carrier for that stage of transport, including any limitations and exceptions contained therein, which contract the Merchant and the Carrier adopt and incorporate by reference, it being agreed that the Carrier's rights and liabilities shall be the same as those of the Subcontractor carrier, but in no 
 
 event whatsoever shall the Carrier's liability exceed GBP 100 sterling legal tender per package, or
 
 (c) if any court shall determine that no international convention, national law or regulation would have been compulsorily applicable and that the Carrier may not determine its liability, if any, by reference to the applicable Subcontractor's contract of carriage or where said Subcontractor carrier does not have a contract of carriage, then it is contractually agreed as between the Merchant and the Carrier that the Carrier's liability shall be determined as if 
 
 the loss and/or damage complained of occurred during the Port-to-Port section of carriage as provided at 5.1 above, but in no event whatsoever shall the Carrier's liability exceed GBP 100 sterling legal tender per package.
 
 d) If the place of loss or damage cannot be established by the Merchant, then the loss or damage shall be presumed to have occurred during the Port-to-Port section of carriage and the Carrier's liability shall be determined as provided at 5.1 above.
 
 5.2.3 Any transport that the Carrier arranges for the Merchant which is not part of the carriage under this Sea Waybill is done under the Merchant's own responsibility, time, risk and expense and the Carrier acts as agent only for the Merchant.
 
 5.3 Delivery to Customs or Port Authorities - Where any law or regulation applicable at the Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery provides that delivery of the Goods to the Merchant shall or may be effected by the customs or port authorities at the Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, delivery of the Goods by the Carrier to such customs or port authorities shall be deemed to be lawful delivery of the 
 
 Goods by the Carrier to the Merchant and the Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to the Goods which occurs for any reason whatsoever after delivery of the Goods by the Carrier to the customs or port authorities.
 
 5.4 Notwithstanding the application to this Sea Waybill of the Hague Rules, or the Hague-Visby Rules, or of any similar convention or legislation, THIS SEA WAYBILL IS NOT A DOCUMENT OF TITLE TO THE GOODS.
 
 6. U.S. TRADE CLAUSE
 
 6.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 5, for carriage to or from any port of the United States, its territories or possessions, or if suit is brought in the United States, this Sea Waybill shall have effect subject to the provisions of the COGSA and to the provisions of the Pomerene Act regardless of whether said Act would apply of its own force. The provisions of the COGSA are incorporated herein and save as otherwise provided herein shall apply 
 
 throughout the entire time the Goods are in the Carrier's custody, including before loading and after discharge as long as the Goods remain in the custody of the Carrier or its Subcontractors, including cargo carried on deck. Nothing contained herein is to be deemed a surrender by the Carrier of its rights, immunities, exemptions or limitations or an increase of any of its responsibilities or liabilities under the COGSA. Except for clause 5, every other 
 
 term, condition, limitation, defence and liberty whatsoever contained in this Sea Waybill shall apply to carriage in the US Trades.
 
 6.2 For limitation purposes under the COGSA, it is agreed that the meaning of the word ""package"" shall be any palletised and/or unitised assemblage of cartons which has been palletised and/or unitised for the convenience of the Merchant, regardless of whether said pallet or unit is disclosed on the front hereof.
 
 7. COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY PROVISIONS
 
 7.1 Subject always to the Carrier's right to limit liability as provided for herein, if the Carrier is liable for compensation in respect of loss of or damage to the Goods, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the invoice value of the Goods, plus Freight and insurance if paid. If there is no invoice value of the Goods or if any such invoice is not bona fide, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the market value of such Goods 
 
 at the place and time they are delivered or should have been delivered to the Merchant. The market value of the Goods shall be fixed according to the current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and/or quality.
 
 7.2 Save as is provided in clause 7.3:
 
 7.2.1 (a) If and to the extent the Hague Rules or Hague-Visby Rules are compulsorily applicable to this Sea Waybill by virtue of clauses 5.1, 5.2.1 or 5.2.2 (c) or (d) or otherwise, the Carrier's liability for breaches or wrongs occurring during such period of compulsory application shall in no event whatsoever exceed the amounts provided in the Hague Rules or Hague-Visby Rules, whichever are compulsorily applicable.
 
 (b) If and to the extent the Hague Rules apply only contractually pursuant to clause 5, the Carrier's maximum liability shall in no event whatsoever exceed GBP 100 sterling lawful currency per package or unit.
 
 7.2.2 Where COGSA applies by virtue of clause 6, neither the Carrier nor the Vessel shall in any event be or become liable in an amount exceeding US$500 per package or per customary freight unit.
 
 7.3 The Merchant agrees and acknowledges that the Carrier has no knowledge of the value of the Goods. Higher compensation than that provided for in this Sea Waybill may be claimed only when, with the written confirmation of the Carrier, the value of the Goods declared by the Shipper upon delivery to the Carrier has been stated by the Carrier in the box marked ""Declared Value"" on the front of this Sea Waybill and ad valorem charges paid. In 
 
 that case, the amount of the Declared Value shall be substituted for the limits provided in this Sea Waybill. Any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the basis of such Declared Value.
 
 7.4 Nothing in this Sea Waybill shall operate to limit or deprive the Carrier of any statutory protection, defence, exemption or limitation of liability authorised by any applicable laws, statutes or regulations of any country or which would have been applicable in the absence of any of the terms set out in this Sea Waybill. The Carrier shall have the benefit of the said laws, statutes or regulations as if it were the owner of the Vessel.
 
 7.5 When any claim is paid by the Carrier to the Merchant, the Carrier shall be automatically subrogated to all rights of the Merchant against any third party. The Merchant shall sign a subrogation receipt, release and indemnity immediately when requested by the Carrier.
 
 8. SCOPE OF VOYAGE, DELAY, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
 
 The scope of voyage herein contracted for may or may not include usual or customary or advertised ports of call whether named in this Sea Waybill contract or not and may include transport of the Goods to or from any facilities used by the Carrier as part of the carriage, including but not limited to off-dock storage. The Carrier does not promise or undertake to load, carry or discharge the Goods on or by any particular Vessel, date or time. Advertised 
 
 sailings and arrivals are only estimated times, and such schedules may be advanced, delayed or cancelled without notice. In no event shall the Carrier be liable for consequential damages or for any delay in scheduled departures or arrivals of any Vessel or other conveyances used to transport the Goods by sea or otherwise. If the Carrier should nevertheless be held legally liable for any such direct or indirect or consequential loss or damage caused 
 
 by such alleged delay, such liability shall in no event exceed the Freight paid for the carriage.
 
 9. METHODS AND ROUTES OF CARRIAGE
 
 9.1 The Carrier may at any time and without notice to the Merchant:
 
 (a) use any means of transport or storage whatsoever;
 
 (b) transfer the Goods from one conveyance to another including transshipping or carrying the Goods on a Vessel other than the Vessel named on the front hereof or by any other means of transport whatsoever, even though transshipment or forwarding of the Goods by such means may not have been contemplated or provided for herein;
 
 (c) sail without pilots, proceed via any route (whether or not the nearest or most direct or customary or advertised route) at any speed and proceed to, return to and stay at any port or place whatsoever (including the Port of Loading herein provided) once or more often, and in any order in or out of the route or in a contrary direction to or beyond the Port of Discharge once or more often;
 
 (d) load and unload the Goods at any place or port (whether or not any such port is named on the front hereof as the Port of Loading or Port of Discharge) and store the Goods at any such port or place, including but not limited to the use of off-dock storage at any port;
 
 (e) comply with any orders or recommendations given by any government or authority or any Person or body purporting to act as or on behalf of such government or authority or having under the terms of the insurance on any conveyance employed by the Carrier the right to give orders or directions.

Anything done or not done in accordance with 
 
 clause 9.1 or any delay arising therefrom shall be deemed to be within the contractual carriage and shall not be a deviation.
 
 10. NOTICE OF CLAIMS, TIME BAR AND JURISDICTION
 
 10.1 Notice - of loss or damage to Goods shall be given in writing to the Carrier or its agent at the Port of Discharge before or at the time of delivery. If the loss or damage is not apparent before or at the time of delivery, notice must be given within three (3) days of delivery to the Merchant or its agent. Claims shall be submitted in writing addressed by the Merchant to the Carrier's agent at the Port of Discharge.
 
 10.2 Time bar - In any event, the Carrier shall be discharged from all liability if suit is not commenced within one (1) year after delivery of the Goods or the date that the Goods should have been delivered for claims related to loss or damage during the Port-to-Port carriage, and for claims related to loss or damage during Inland Transport the shorter of nine (9) months or any time limit provided for by any applicable international convention, national law, 
 
 regulation or contract by virtue of clauses 5.2.2 (a) or (b).
 
 10.3 Jurisdiction - It is hereby specifically agreed that any suit by the Merchant, and save as additionally provided below any suit by the Carrier, shall be filed exclusively in the High Court of London and English Law shall exclusively apply, unless the carriage contracted for hereunder was to or from the United States of America, in which case suit shall be filed exclusively in the United States District Court, for the Southern District of New York and 
 
 U.S. law shall exclusively apply. The Merchant agrees that it shall not institute suit in any other court and agrees to be responsible for the reasonable legal expenses and costs of the Carrier in removing a suit filed in another forum. The Merchant waives any objection to the personal jurisdiction over the Merchant of the above agreed fora.
 
 In the case of any dispute relating to Freight or other sums due from the Merchant to the Carrier, the Carrier may, at its sole option, bring suit against the Merchant in the fora agreed above, or in the countries of the Port of Loading, Port of Discharge, Place of Delivery or in any jurisdiction where the Merchant has a place of business.

 (a) the manner in which the Goods have been packed, stowed, stuffed or secured in the Container, or
 
 (b) the unsuitability of the Goods for carriage in the Container supplied or for carriage by Container between the Ports or Places specified herein, or
 
 (c) the unsuitability or defective condition of the Container or the incorrect setting of any refrigeration controls thereof, provided that, if the Container has been supplied by or on behalf of the Carrier, this unsuitability or defective condition would have been apparent upon inspection by the Merchant at or prior to the time when the Container was packed, or
 
 (d) packing refrigerated Goods that are not properly pre-cooled to the correct temperature for carriage or before the refrigerated Container has been properly pre-cooled to the correct carrying temperature.
 
 11.3 The Merchant is responsible for the packing and sealing of all Merchant-packed Containers and, if a Merchant-packed Container is delivered by the Carrier with an original seal as affixed by the Merchant or customs or security control intact, or the Carrier can establish bona fide circumstances in which the original seal was replaced, the Carrier shall not be liable for any shortage of Goods ascertained upon delivery.
 
 11.4 The Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier against any loss, damage, liability or expense whatsoever and howsoever arising caused by one or more of the matters referred to in clause 11. 2, including but not limited to damage to Container, other cargo and the Vessel.
 
 12. REFRIGERATION, HEATING, INSULATION
 
 12.1 Special Containers with refrigeration, heating or insulation shall not be furnished unless contracted for on the front of this Sea Waybill and extra Freight paid. If a carrying temperature is noted on the front of this Sea Waybill, the Merchant shall deliver the Goods to the Carrier at plus or minus 2 degrees Celsius from the noted temperature, and the Carrier shall exercise due diligence to maintain such supply air temperature, plus or minus 2 degrees 
 
 Celsius while the Goods are in its possession. IT IS THE MERCHANT'S OBLIGATION TO SET AND/OR CHECK THAT THE TEMPERATURE CONTROLS ON THE CONTAINER ARE AT THE REQUIRED CARRYING TEMPERATURE AND TO PROPERLY SET THE VENTS. The Carrier does not undertake to deliver empty refrigerated Containers to the Merchant at any specific temperature. The Carrier has the right but not the obligation to 
 
 refuse any Container loaded by the Merchant for shipment where the Goods are not or were not loaded into the Container within plus or minus 2 degrees Celsius of the contracted carrying temperature.
 
 12.2 The Merchant must take note that refrigerated Containers are not designed:
 
 (a) to cool or freeze Goods which have been loaded into a Container at a temperature higher than their designated carrying temperature. The Carrier shall not be responsible for the consequences of the Goods being loaded at a higher temperature than that required for the carriage; nor
 
 (b) to monitor and control humidity levels, even if a setting facility exists, and because humidity is influenced by many external factors the Carrier does not guarantee and is not responsible for the maintenance of any intended level of humidity inside any Container.
 
 12.3 The Carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage to the Goods arising from latent defects, breakdown, defrosting, stoppage of the refrigerating or any other specialised machinery, plant, insulation and/or apparatus of the Container and any other facilities, provided that the Carrier exercised due diligence before releasing the empty Container to the Shipper.
 
 12.4 The Carrier does not warrant refrigeration or heating machinery, but shall exercise care in its operation and maintenance while in the actual possession of the Carrier. The Carrier will not accept responsibility for the recording of temperatures in any form other than any reefer log book maintained on board the Vessel. The Carrier does not accept to comply with any governmental program or protocol unless noted on the front hereof and additional 
 
 Freight is paid.
 
 13. INSPECTION OF GOODS AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
 
 Inspection - The Carrier shall be entitled, but shall be under no obligation, to open and/or scan any package or Container at any time and to inspect, verify and weigh the contents without notice to the Merchant.
 
 Special circumstances - If it appears at any time that the Goods cannot safely or properly be carried or carried further, either at all or without incurring any additional expense or taking any measures in relation to the Container or the Goods, the Carrier may without notice to the Merchant (but as his agent only) take any measures and/or incur any reasonable additional expense to carry or to continue the carriage of the Goods, and/or to sell or dispose of 
 
 them and/or to abandon the carriage and/or to store them ashore or afloat, under cover or in the open, at any place, whichever the Carrier in its absolute discretion considers most appropriate, and any sale, disposal, abandonment or storage shall be deemed to constitute due delivery under this Sea Waybill. The Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier against any additional expense so incurred. The Carrier in exercising the liberties contained in this 
 
 clause shall not be under any obligation to take any particular measures and shall not be liable for any loss, delay or damage howsoever arising from any action or lack of action under this clause.
 
 14. DESCRIPTION OF GOODS AND MERCHANT'S RESPONSIBILITY
 
 14.1 This Sea Waybill shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the Carrier in apparent good order and condition, except as otherwise noted, of the total number of Containers or other packages or units indicated in the box entitled ""Carriers Receipt"" on the front hereof.
 
 14.2 No representation is made by the Carrier as to the weight, contents, measure, quantity, quality, description, condition, temperature, marks, numbers or value of the Goods and the Carrier shall be under no responsibility whatsoever in respect of such description or particulars.
 
 14.3 The Merchant warrants to the Carrier that the particulars relating to the Goods as set out on the front hereof have been checked by or on behalf of the Merchant on receipt of this Sea Waybill and that such particulars, and any other particulars furnished by or on behalf of the Merchant, are adequate and correct. The Merchant warrants that the Goods are safely and securely packed in the Container.
 
 14.4. The Merchant also warrants that the Goods and/or Merchant-packed Containers are lawful Goods, contain no contraband, drugs, other illegal substances or stowaways, and that any hazardous or potentially dangerous characteristics of the Goods have been fully disclosed by or on behalf of the Merchant and that they will not cause loss, damage or expense to the Carrier, or to any other cargo, Containers, Vessel or Person during the carriage.
 
 14.5 If any particulars of any letter of credit and/or import license and/or sales contract and/or invoice or order number and/or details of any contract to which the Carrier is not a party are shown on the front hereof, such particulars are shown at the sole risk of the Merchant and for his convenience. The Merchant agrees that such particulars shall not be regarded as a declaration of value and shall in no circumstances whatsoever increase the Carrier's 
 
 liability under this Sea Waybill, and the Merchant agrees to indemnify the Carrier for any increased liability so caused, including reasonable legal expenses and costs.
 
 14.6 The Merchant shall comply with all regulations or requirements of customs, port and other authorities, and shall bear and pay all duties, taxes, fines, imposts, expenses or losses (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing Freight for any additional carriage undertaken), incurred or suffered by reason thereof, or by reason of any illegal, incorrect or insufficient declaration, marking, numbering or addressing of the Goods, and shall 
 
 indemnify the Carrier in respect thereof, including reasonable legal expenses and costs.
 
 14.7 If by order of the authorities at any place, Goods are detained and/or seized and/or a Container has to be opened for the Goods to be inspected for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to for a breach or infringement of a trademark, patent or other intellectual property right, the Carrier will not be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever incurred as a result of any opening, unpacking, inspection, re-packing, detention, destruction or delay. 
 
 The Carrier shall be entitled to recover from the Merchant all charges, fines, costs, losses and expenses, including reasonable legal expenses and costs resulting from such action, including but not limited to any detention, demurrage and storage charges for the Goods and/or the Container.
 
 14.8 The Carrier allows a period of free time for the use of the Containers and other equipment in accordance with the Tariff and as advised by the local MSC agent at the Ports of Loading and Discharge. Free time commences from the day the Container and other equipment is collected by the Merchant or is discharged from the Vessel or is delivered to the Place of Delivery as the case may be. The Merchant is required and has the responsibility to 
 
 return to a place nominated by the Carrier the Container and other equipment before or at the end of the free time allowed at the Port of Discharge or the Place of Delivery. Demurrage, per diem and detention charges will be levied and payable by the Merchant thereafter in accordance with the Tariff.
 
 16. FREIGHT AND CHARGES
 
 16.1 Freight has been calculated on the basis of the Shipper's particulars and if such particulars are found to be erroneous and additional Freight is payable, the Merchant shall be liable therefor and also for any expense thereby incurred.
 
 16.2 All Freight is earned and due upon receipt of the Goods by the Carrier, whether the Freight is prepaid or collect and the Carrier shall be entitled to all Freight due under all circumstances, ship and/or cargo lost or not lost or the voyage abandoned. All Freight shall be paid when due without any set-off, counter claim, or deduction.
 
 16.3 Every Person defined as ""Merchant"" in clause 1 shall be jointly and severally liable to the Carrier for the payment of all Freight and charges and for the performance of the obligations of each of them hereunder. Any Person engaged by the Merchant to perform forwarding services with respect to the Goods shall be considered to be exclusively the Merchant's agent for all purposes, and any payment of Freight to such Person shall not be 
 
 considered payment to the Carrier in any event whatsoever. Failure of such third parties to pay any part of the Freight to the Carrier shall be considered a default by the Merchant in the payment of Freight.
 
 17. CARRIER'S LIEN
 
 The Carrier, its servants or agents shall have a lien on the Goods and any document relating thereto for Freight and for general average contributions to whomsoever due. The Carrier, its servants or agents shall also have a lien against the Merchant on the Goods and any document relating thereto for all sums due from the Merchant to the Carrier under any other contract. The Carrier may exercise its lien at any time and any place in its sole 
 
 discretion, through the action of any servant, agent or Subcontractor, whether the contractual carriage is completed or not. The Carrier's lien shall also extend to cover the cost and legal expense of recovering any sums due. The Carrier shall have the right to sell any Goods liened by public auction or private treaty, without notice to the Merchant. Nothing herein shall prevent the Carrier from recovering from the Merchant the difference between the 
 
 amount due to the Carrier and the net amount realised by such sale.
 
 18. OPTIONAL STOWAGE, DECK CARGO AND LIVESTOCK
 
 18.1 Goods, whether packed in Containers or not, may be carried on deck or under deck without notice to the Merchant unless it is specifically stipulated on the front hereof that the Containers or Goods will be carried under deck. If carried on deck, the Carrier shall not be required to note, mark or stamp on the Sea Waybill any statement of such on-deck carriage. Save as provided in clause 18.2 such Goods (except livestock) carried on or under deck 
 
 and whether or not stated to be carried on deck shall participate in general average and shall be deemed to be within the definition of Goods for the purpose of the Hague Rules or the COGSA or any compulsorily applicable legislation and shall be carried subject to such Rules or Act, whichever is applicable.
 
 18.2. Goods which are out of gauge and/or are stowed on or in open top containers, flatracks or platforms, and which are stated on the front hereof to be carried on deck, and all livestock whether carried on deck or under deck, are carried without any responsibility whatsoever on the part of the Carrier for loss or damage of whatsoever nature or delay arising during the carriage whether caused by unseaworthiness or negligence or any other cause 
 
 whatsoever and the Hague Rules or the COGSA shall not apply.
 
 19. MATTERS ADVERSELY AFFECTING CARRIER'S PERFORMANCE
 
 19.1 If at any time the carriage is or is likely to be affected by any hindrance, risk, danger, delay, difficulty or disadvantage of whatsoever kind and howsoever arising which cannot be avoided by the Carrier by the exercise of reasonable endeavours, (even though the circumstances giving rise to such hindrance, risk, danger, delay, difficulty or disadvantage existed at the time this contract was entered into or the Goods were received for the carriage) 
 
 the Carrier may at its sole discretion and without notice to the Merchant and whether or not the carriage is commenced either:
 
 (a) carry the Goods to the contracted Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery, whichever is applicable, by an alternative route to that indicated in this Sea Waybill or that which is usual for Goods consigned to that Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery; or
 
 (b) suspend the carriage of the Goods and store them ashore or afloat upon the terms and conditions of this Sea Waybill and endeavour to forward them as soon as possible, but the Carrier makes no representations as to the maximum period of suspension; or
 
 (c) abandon the carriage of the Goods and place them at the Merchant's disposal at any place or port which the Carrier may deem safe and convenient, or from which the Carrier is unable by the exercise of reasonable endeavours to continue the carriage, whereupon the responsibility of the Carrier in respect of such Goods shall cease. The Carrier shall nevertheless be entitled to full Freight on the Goods received for the carriage, and the Merchant 
 
 shall pay any additional costs incurred by reason of the abandonment of the Goods. If the Carrier elects to use an alternative route under clause 19.1 (a) or to suspend the carriage under clause 19.1 (b) this shall not prejudice its right subsequently to abandon the carriage.
 
 19.2 If the Carrier elects to invoke the terms of this clause 19, then notwithstanding the provisions of clause 9, the Carrier shall be entitled to such additional Freight and costs as the Carrier may determine.
 
 20. NOTIFICATION AND DELIVERY
 
 20.1 Any mention in this Sea Waybill of parties to be notified of the arrival of the Goods is solely for information of the Carrier. Failure to give such notification shall not subject the Carrier to any liability nor relieve the Merchant of any obligation hereunder.
 
 20.2 Should the Shipper request the Carrier to deliver the Goods to a Person other than the Consignee named on the front hereof, agreement to such change shall be at the Carrier's sole discretion and the Carrier shall in any event not accept such change unless the Shipper's request is in writing and it is received by the Carrier in good time before notice of arrival of the Goods has been sent out by the Carrier's agent at destination. The Shipper hereby 
 
 undertakes to indemnify the Carrier against any additional costs, expenses, delays and losses caused thereby.
 
 20.3 The Merchant shall take delivery of the Goods within the time provided for in the Carrier's applicable Tariff or as otherwise agreed. If the Merchant fails to do so, the Carrier may without notice unpack the Goods if packed in Containers and/or store the Goods ashore, afloat, in the open or under cover at the sole risk of the Merchant. Such storage shall constitute due delivery hereunder, and thereupon all liability whatsoever of the Carrier in 
 
 respect of the Goods, including for misdelivery or non-delivery, shall cease and the costs of such storage shall forthwith upon demand be paid by the Merchant to the Carrier.
 
 20.4 If the Goods are unclaimed within a reasonable time or whenever in the Carrier's opinion the Goods are likely to deteriorate, decay or become worthless, or incur charges whether for storage or otherwise in excess of their value, the Carrier may at its discretion and without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the Merchant, without notice and without any responsibility attaching to it, sell, abandon or otherwise dispose of the 
 
 Goods at the sole risk and expense of the Merchant and apply any proceeds of sale in reduction of the sums due to the Carrier from the Merchant under or in connection with this Sea Waybill.
 
 20.5 Refusal by the Merchant to take delivery of the Goods in accordance with the terms of this clause and/or to mitigate any loss or damage thereto shall constitute an absolute waiver and abandonment by the Merchant to the Carrier of any claim whatsoever relating to the Goods or the carriage thereof. The Carrier shall be entitled to an indemnity from the Merchant for all costs whatsoever incurred, including legal costs, for the cleaning and 
 
 disposal of Goods refused and/or abandoned by the Merchant.
 
 21. BOTH TO BLAME COLLISION CLAUSE
 
 If the Vessel comes into collision with another ship as a result of the negligence of the other ship and any act, neglect or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the Carrier in the navigation or in the management of the Vessel, the owners of the Goods carried hereunder will indemnify the Carrier against all loss or liability to the other or non-carrying ship or her owners in so far as such loss or liability represents loss of, or damage to, or 
 
 any claim whatsoever of the owners of said Goods, paid or payable by the other or non-carrying ship or her owners to the owners of said Goods and set-off, recouped or recovered by the other or non-carrying ship or her owners as part of their claim against the Vessel or Carrier. The foregoing provisions shall also apply where the owners, operators or those in charge of any ship or ships or objects other than, or in addition to, the colliding ships or 
 
 objects are at fault in respect of a collision or contact.
 
 22. GENERAL AVERAGE AND SALVAGE
 
 General Average shall be adjusted, stated and settled at any port or place at the Carrier's option according to York - Antwerp Rules 1994 except Rule XXII and, as to matters not therein provided for, according to the laws and usages at any port or place at the Carrier's option, save that General Average on a Vessel not bareboat chartered by the Carrier shall be adjusted according to the requirements of the owner or operator of that Vessel. Average 
 
 agreement or bond and such cash deposit (payable at Carrier's option in United States currency) as the Carrier may require as additional security for the contribution of the Goods and salvage and special charges thereon, shall be furnished before delivery or forwarding.
 
 In the event of accident, danger, damage or disaster, before or after commencement of the voyage resulting from any cause whatsoever, whether due to negligence or not, for which, or for the consequence of which, the Carrier is not responsible by statute, contract, or otherwise, the Goods and the Merchant shall, jointly and severally, contribute with the Carrier in General Average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses, or expenses of a General 
 
 Average nature that may be made or incurred, and shall pay salvage and special charges incurred in respect of the Goods, as determined by an independent General Average adjuster duly appointed by the Carrier, and his determination as to liability for General Average contribution and his computation for the same shall be final and binding on all parties to the venture. If a salving ship is owned or operated by the Carrier, salvage shall be paid for as 
 
 fully and in the same manner as if such salvaging ship or ships belonged to strangers. Such deposit as the Carrier or its agents may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the goods and any salvage and special charges thereon shall, if required, be made by the Goods, Shippers, Consignees or owners of the Goods to the Carrier before delivery.
 
 23. SEPARABILITY AND VARIATION OF TERMS, FINAL CONTRACT
 
 The terms of this Sea Waybill shall be separable and, if any term or provision hereof or any part of any term or provision shall be invalid to any extent, it shall be invalid to that extent, but no further and such circumstance shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other term or provision hereof. This Sea Waybill is the final contract between the parties which supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, whether in writing or verbal, save

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à défaut
 de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale européenne à son
 
 opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.

 Taux d'escompte pour paiement anticipé : Non applicable
 En cas de contestation, les tribunaux de Paris sont seuls compétents quels que soient les conditions et le mode de paiement, même en cas de demande
 
 incidente, demande en garantie ou de pluralité de défenseurs. Conformément à l'article 444-6 du code du commerce, des pénalités de retard sont dues à
 défaut de règlement le jour suivant la date de paiement qui figure sur la facture. Ce taux est égal au taux d'intérêt appliqué par la Banque centrale
 
 européenne à son opération de refinancement majoré de 10 points de pourcentage.
